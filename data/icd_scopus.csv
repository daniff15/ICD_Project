Examples of Open Data can be data on mobility or pollution, which an increasing number of cities are making available to citizens. In education, the novel field of Open Data has the potential of empowering a young generation with digital skills and critical thinking through work with real-life Open Data. However, the scarcity of methods and tools for skills development and insertion into educational designs reduces the possibility of achieving this potential. This study is part of the project ODECO, aimed at addressing challenges in the creation of Open Data ecosystems in several contexts, such as education. A systematic mapping review was conducted to uncover the research connections between Open Data education and educational games. Twenty-eight studies were identified and analysed through iterative searching and including keywords related to Gamification, Open Data and Education. In doing this, relevant themes and novel approaches in the current literature were found. This paper discusses how the fields of Open Data education and educational games methodologically and theoretically contribute to outline a game-based approach for Open Data in education. An Open Data Gamified Education Framework leads to authentic learning experiences for real-world problem solving in relation to eight actions: connecting classroom activities to real facts, empowering students to act with Open Data, supporting technical Open Data skills in the classroom, building literacy and developing skills, enhancing civic participation, creating more realistic and appealing narratives, extending teaching outside the classroom by collecting data in real time and local settings, and increasing engagement and motivation. © 2022 Dechema e.V..

This design-based research was carried out in two implementations, in which two different graduate courses were designed using gamification. The design portion of the study was followed by an assessment, based on which a framework for gamification design was constructed. It was found that the competition-based and intriguing activities of high intrinsic interest resulted in concrete achievements, which motivated the students by giving them a sense of play. In addition, the implementations that supported learning were found to be both collaborative and individual activities that mobilized the students into active participation. In both implementations, the students reported enjoying most of the activities and lessons and found that the competitive implementations incorporating social games into the lesson topics increased their motivation. The resulting framework for the gamification design specifies recommended elements of gamification for increasing learner motivation, active participation, fun, and learning. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Game Mechanics and Dynamics; Gamification Design Elements; Gamification in Education; Instructional Design,Curricula; Game design; Motivation; Design elements; Design-based research; Educational settings; Game mechanic and dynamic; Gamification; Gamification design element; Gamification in education; Graduate course; Instructional designs; Students,,,,,,,"Baxter R.J., Holderness D.K., Wood D.A., Applying basic gamification techniques to IT compliance training: Evidence from the lab and field, Journal of information systems, 30, 3, pp. 119-133, (2016); Brookfield S.D., Rudolph J., Yeo E., The power of critical thinking in learning and teaching.

This has increased the need for gamified learning systems (GLS) to make the educational process more attractive and increase the engagement as well as the participation of all stakeholders. The use of GLS in teaching and learning has not been deployed effectively in the educational systems in developing countries. The purpose of this study was to examine the predictors of using GLS in Iraqi smart schools. Building on the literature, a framework of GLS is proposed. Data used in this study were collected from 394 teachers and managerial staff in Iraqi smart schools and analysed using Partial Least Square. The findings showed that individuals and organizations are important predictors of using GLS, and their effects on BI are mediated by satisfaction. Readiness and performance expectancy are critical for adopting and using GLS by smart schools. In addition, the findings showed that gamification and self-efficacy are moderating variables. Important implications of the predictability of GLS using a combination of theories as well as the practical suggestions for decision makers to enhance the adoption of GLS among smart schools in Iraq are discussed. In the time of COVID-19, decision makers have suggested increasing gamification features of teaching and learning to reduce anxiety and achieve a better learning process. © 2021, King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology.",Games; Gamification; Gamified learning system; Improving classroom teaching; Media in education,Decision making; Developing countries; Human resource management; Decision makers; Educational process; Game; Gamification; Gamified learning system; Improving classroom teaching; Media in education; Smart schools; Teachers'; Teaching and learning; Learning systems,,,,,,,"Adnan N., Nordin S.M., Rasli A.M., A possible resolution of Malaysian sunset industry by green fertilizer technology: factors affecting the adoption among paddy farmers, Environ Sci Pollut Res, 26, 26, pp. 27198-27224, (2019); Adukaite A., van Zyl I., Er S., Cantoni L., Teacher perceptions on the use of digital gamified learning in tourism education: the case of South African secondary schools, Comput Educ, 111, pp. 172-190, (2017); Ajzen I., The theory of planned behavior, Organ Behav Hum Decis Process, (1991); Al Hayani B., Ilhan H., Image transmission over decode and forward based cooperative wireless multimedia sensor networks for Rayleigh fading channels in medical Internet of Things (MIoT) for remote health-care and health communication monitoring, J Med Imaging Health Inform, 10, 1, pp. 160-168, (2020); Al Hayani B., Ilhan H., Visual sensor intelligent module based image transmission in industrial manufacturing for monitoring and manipulation problems, J Intell Manuf, 32, pp. 597-610, (2021); Alamgir Hossain M., Quaddus M., The adoption and continued usage intention of RFID: an integrated framework, Inf Technol People, 24, 3, pp. 236-256, (2011); Alhayani B., Abdallah A.A., Manufacturing intelligent Corvus corone module for a secured two way image transmission under WSN, Eng Comput, (2020); Alhayani B., Abbas S.T., Mohammed H.J., Et al., Intelligent secured two-way image transmission using Corvus Corone Module over WSN, Wirel Pers Commun, (2021); Alkharusi M.H., Al-Badi A.H., IT personnel perspective of the slow adoption of Cloud Computing in public sector: Case study in Oman, 3Rd MEC International Conference on Big Data and Smart City IT, pp. 7-16, (2016); Aparicio M., Oliveira T., Bacao F., Painho M., Gamification: a key determinant of massive open online course (MOOC) success, Inf Manag, 56, 1, pp. 39-54, (2019); Aydin G., Adoption of gamified systems: a study on a social media gamification website, Int J Online Market, 5, 3, pp. 18-37, (2015); Baptista G., Oliveira T., Why so serious?

To the best of our knowledge, no researchers have explored the impact of non-game incentives, especially in the context of educating students about programming plagiarism and collusion. This study compares two categories of non-game incentives: grade-relevant (i.e., bonus marks) and grade-irrelevant (i.e., money prizes). A quasi-experiment involving two comparable application programming courses was conducted for one academic semester. Both courses use gamification integrated into our online assessment submission system, which automatically educates students about programming plagiarism and collusion. Our study finds that students with grade-relevant incentives perform slightly better than those with grade-irrelevant incentives in terms of learning outcome and student engagement with the learning activities. However, they submit their programs later, knowing that the rewards can be diminished by poorer academic performance. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Academic integrity; Gamification; Non-game incentives; Programming education; Quasi-experiment,Education computing; Intellectual property; Academic integrity; Academic semester; Application programming; Gamification; Non-game incentive; On-line assessment; Programming course; Programming education; Quasi-experiments; Student participation; Students,,,,,,,"Infineon Technologies AG, AN2019-5 “PC and TC diagrams, Application Note, (2019); Allen J.M., Vahid F., Downey K., Edgcomb A.D., Weekly programs in a CS1 class: Experiences with auto-graded many-small programs (MSP), ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition, Pp. 1–13.

With the rapid development of information technology, games have gradually integrated into our lives. Gamification has been applied to stimulate students learning interests and strengthen their motivation by incorporating game design elements in educational environments. This paper first elaborates on the current trends of gamified learning and the transformation of underachievers. Next, this research reviews the theoretical basis and defines the relevant concepts of gamified learning. Then, through questionnaires and interviews, the paper investigates the learning status of the underachievers with the gamified platform – GamiClass based on ADDIE instructional design model and Grasha Learning Styles. A total of 10 underachievers among 76 Raffles University Malaysia Innovation module students were selected for practical analysis. This experiment investigated gamification feasibility and effectiveness in the transformation of underachievers. This research found that gamification could effectively improve the underachievers' learning interest. Game elements such as meaning, onboard tutorial, social pressure and guild/teams are necessary for a gamified learning platform to motivate underachievers in online lesson participation. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Active participation; Gamification; Gamified learning; Motivation; Underachievers,Education computing; Game design; Learning systems; Students; Surveys; Academic performance; Active participation; Design elements; Game design; Gamification; Gamified learning; Learning attitudes; Learning experiences; Student learning; Underachiever; Motivation,,,,,"Institute of Human Centered Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, (R.J130000.7809.4L870); Ministry of Higher Education and Media and Game Innovation Centre of Excellence","This research was partially supported by the Ministry of Higher Education and Media and Game Innovation Centre of Excellence, Institute of Human Centered Engineering, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Skudai, Johor, Malaysia, through Malaysia Research University Network research grant (R.J130000.7809.4L870)","Supendi R., Analysis of underachieving students’ problems and the given guidance, ProGCouns: J.

Promoting low-carbon actions is an effective means of alleviating climate problems. Gamified interactions have recently emerged as a promising and practical idea to promote low-carbon actions; however, research on the effect of gamification design on consumers' pro-environmental behavior is still at a nascent stage. This study tried to explore the impact mechanisms of two common gamified interactions, competition and cooperation, on consumers' low-carbon actions through goal-framing theory. The proposed hypotheses were tested using a structural equation model based on survey data collected from Ant Forest users on Alipay, one of the popular online payment platforms in China. The results show that while both cooperative and competitive interactions could promote users' low-carbon actions, the incentive effect of cooperation was more significant. In addition, cooperative interactions stimulated users' normative, hedonic, and gain motivations to adopt low-carbon actions, whereas competitive interactions only motivated hedonic and gain goals. The study findings provide new insights into the role of gamification in influencing low-carbon behaviors and offer practical guidance for the design of gamification for related green and low-carbon platforms. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Competitive interaction; Cooperative interaction; Gamification design; Goal-framing theory; Pro-environmental behavior; User participation,Carbon; China; Ecosystem; Gamification; Humans; Motivation; China; Carbon; Climate change; Consumer behavior; Electronic commerce; carbon; Competitive interactions; Cooperation and competitions; Cooperative interactions; Gamification; Gamification design; Goal-framing theory; Low carbon; On-line payment; Pro-environmental behaviors; User participation; carbon emission; climate change; incentive; research work; adult; Article; behavior change; China; confirmatory factor analysis; controlled study; convergent validity; e-learning; empirical research; energy consumption; environmental protection; female; gamification; graduate education; human; incentive; information system; intrinsic motivation; major clinical study; male; pro-environmental behavior; questionnaire; scanning electron microscopy; social environment; social interaction; social responsibility; ecosystem; motivation; Forestry,,"carbon, 7440-44-0; Carbon, ",,,"Excellent Youth Fund Project of Hunan Provincial Department of Education, (19B041); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (71972182, 72274055); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, (2020JJ2051, 2022JJ30176); Henan Province Science and Technology Innovation Talent Program, (2021RC4007)",This work was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( 71972182 ; 72274055 ); the Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province ( 2020JJ2051 ; 2022JJ30176 ); the Leading Project of Hunan Science and Technology Innovation Talent Program ( 2021RC4007 ); the Excellent Youth Fund Project of Hunan Provincial Department of Education ( 19B041 ).,"Allam A., Kostova Z., Nakamoto K., Schulz P.J., The effect of social support features and gamification on a web-based intervention for rheumatoid arthritis patients: randomized controlled trial, J.

This research paper proposed a new gamification assessment model to investigate how gamification can first impact student learning interaction, student's satisfaction, increasing student's motivation, student's engagement, and addressing needs of student. In order to encourage students to answer questions relevant to their taught modules, a question board is designed and implemented where academic staff can also contribute and validate the most correct responses. In order to investigate the gamification effect over time, the acquisition of data is carried out. The gamified platform was incorporated with a university's online e-learning portal where e-learning adoption is considered extremely weak. The findings obtained have shown that gamification can be seen as a powerful tool for enticing users to use educational systems and increasing their interactivity and interaction.  © 2023 Author(s).",,,,,,,,,"Conkova M., Analysis of perceptions of conventional and e-learning education in corporate training, Journal of Competitiveness, 5, 4, (2013); Al-Adwan A.S., Al-Madadha A., Zvirzdinaite Z., Modeling students' readiness to adopt mobile learning in higher education: An empirical study, International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning, 19, 1, (2018); Qteishat M., Alshibly H., Al-Ma'aitah M., Factors influencing the adoption of e-learning in Jordan: An extended TAM model, European Journal of Business and Management, 5, 18, pp. 84-100, (2013); Simoes J., Redondo R.D., Vilas A.F., A social gamification framework for a K-6 learning platform, Computers in Human Behavior, 29, 2, pp. 345-353, (2013); Surendeleg G., The role of gamification in education-a literature review, Contemporary Engineering Sciences, 7, 29, pp. 1609-1616, (2014); Dicheva D., Dichev C., (2015); Poole S.M., Get your head in the game: Using gamification in business education to connect with Generation Y, (2014); Glover I., Play as you learn: gamification as a technique for motivating learners. in EdMedia+ Innovate Learning, Association for the Advancement of Computing in Education (AACE), (2013); Yucel U.A., Gulbahar Y., Egitim Bilimleri Fakultesi Dergisi, 46, 1, (2013); Cheong C., Filippou J., Cheong F., Journal of Information Systems Education, 25, 3, (2014); Caponetto I., Earp J., Ott M., Gamification and education: A literature review, (2014); Dicheva D., Educational Technology & Society, 18, 3, pp. 75-88, (2015); Al-Adwan A., Smedley J., International Journal of Education and Development using ICT, 8, 1, (2012); Langendahl, Cook M., Mark-Herbert C., Gamification in higher education, (2016); Geelan B., Australian Educational Computing, 30, 1, (2015); Stott A., Neustaedter C., Surrey, BC, Canada, (2013); Langendahl P.A., Cook M., Mark-Herbert C., Gamification in Higher Education: Toward a Pedagogy to Engage and Motivate, Department of Economics, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, (2016); Sclater N., Peasgood A., Mullan J., Learning analytics in higher education.

These changes have required a transformation in the current educational paradigm, where active methodologies and ICT have become vehicles for achieving this goal, designing complete teaching sequences with STEM approaches that help students to learn. Under a gamified approach, this document addresses a didactic proposal in geometry focused on STEM disciplines. This proposal combines tools such as AR, VR, manipulative materials, and social networks, with techniques such as m-learning, cooperative-learning, and flipped-learning, which make methodological transformation possible. The research was carried out during two academic years under an action research framework. It departed from a traditional methodology and, in two cycles, methodology was improved with the benefits that gamification brings to STEM proposals in Secondary Education. The data gathered in the experiment were analysed following a mixed method. Learning produced, strategies employed, successes and errors, and results of a questionnaire are presented. Evidence shows an improvement in academic performance from 50% fails to 100% pass, most of the students ended up motivated, participation was of the whole group, more than 80% showed positive emotions, and thanks to the cooperative-learning, group cohesion was improved. © 2022 by the authors.",action research; augmented reality; breakout EDU; gamification; geometry education; ICT; motivation; STEM; virtual reality,,,,,,"FEDER-Andalusian Regional Government, (UAL2020-SEJ-B2086); Universidad de Málaga, UMA; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF",This study was partially funded by the ERDF (European Regional Development Fund) research project from the FEDER-Andalusian Regional Government grant UAL2020-SEJ-B2086 and by University of Málaga (Spain).,"Maass K., Geiger V., Ariza M.R., Goos M., The role of mathematics in interdisciplinary STEM education, ZDM Int.

The study then examines to what extent is game-based learning effective in motivating students and teachers to learn and teach better, with a close analysis on the direct and indirect correlations between game-based learning and the level of participation and engagement in face-to-face classrooms and remote learning. The research finally explores learners’ and educators’ technological literacy and training received, with reference to the availability of institutional support towards game-based learning in university English classes in Hong Kong. The study implies the possibility in accelerating future course redesign and assessment restructuring as a result of a switch to the new learning and teaching mode. The research also provides a framework to further study the feasibility in applying gamification in other subjects in the new technological era. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Face-to-face classrooms; Gamification; Language learning; Motivation; Online learning,,,,,,,,"Campillo-Ferrer G.M., Miralles-Martinez P., Sanchez-Ibanez R., Gamification in higher education: impact on student motivation and the acquisition of social and civic key competencies, MDPI, 12, 12, (2020); Fridolin S.T.T., Lam W.H., Ronnie H.S., Active learning via problem-based collaborative games in a large mathematics university course in Hong Kong, Educ Sci, 9, 3, (2019); Kapp K., The gamification of learning and instruction: Game-based methods and strategies for training and education, (2012); Kotob M.M., Ibrahim L.A., Gamification: The effect on students’ motivation and achievement in language learning, J Appl Linguist Lang Res, 6, 1, pp. 177-198, (2019); Liao C.Y., Chen Z.H., Cheng H.N., Chan T.W., Effects of friendship relations and gender differences on classroom-based surrogate competitive learning, J Comput Educ, 5, 3, pp. 259-277, (2018); Luu T.N., Thi M.D., Teaching english grammar through games, Stud Lit Lang, 1, 7, pp. 61-75, (2010); Redjeki I.S., Muhajir R., Gamification in EFL classroom to support teaching and learning in 21st century, JEES, 6, 1, pp. 68-78, (2021)","S.

Thus, it aims to present a roadmap for future studies. In this context, bibliometric and descriptive analysis methods were used in the study carried out with the descriptive survey model. 1970 studies were accessed using the Web of Science (WoS) database to reach the data within the scope of the research. As a result of the filtering process on the database, the distribution of the relevant publications by year, document type, publication language, country and WoS indexes, the most influential institutions and research, cooperation between institutions and countries, the most cited authors, and the most studied topics were reviewed. According to the research results, the studies on blended learning in higher education were primarily published in the form of articles in English between the years 2002-2021. It is also deduced that Spain stands out, especially in producing publications, and these studies are generally published in the Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH) index type. The most active journal with high citation density is Computers & Education, and the country that collaborates most is England. Regarding the keywords used in the articles, while the concepts of online learning, higher education, and student participation are prominent in the studies conducted in the first years, the concepts such as flipped classrooms, Edmodo, sustainability, gamification, mobile learning, and emotions came to the fore in the following years. In this context, discussions were conducted within the framework of the literature, and suggestions were made related to the findings obtained. © (2023), All Rights Reserved.",bibliometric analyses; bibliometric mapping; Blended learning; higher education,,,,,,,,"Abass O.

Based on a sample of 301 first year Economics and Law university students and using the Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modelling approach, all the relationships among first-order and second-order constructs included in the model are validated. The results support all the hypotheses studied, confirming the positive relationship that both students’ individual attitude and social interactions have on participation in collaborative and gamified online learning activities. The results also show that participating in those activities is positively related with class- and test-related emotions. The main contribution of the study is the validation of the effect of collaborative and gamified online learning on university students’ emotional well-being through the analysis of their attitude and social interactions. Moreover, this is the first time in the specialised learning literature that students’ attitude is considered as a second-order construct operationalised by three factors: the perceived usefulness that this digital resource brings to the students, the entertainment that this digital resource brings to the students, and the predisposition to use this digital resource among all those available in online training. Our findings aim to shed light for educators when preparing and designing computer mediated and online teaching programs that seek to generate positive emotions as a motivation for students. © 2023, The Author(s).","Achievement emotions questionnaire; Attitude, social interactions, and participation; Gamification and collaborative learning; Higher education; Online learning",,,,,,,,"Adedoyin O.B., Soykan E., Covid-19 pandemic and online learning: The challenges and opportunities, Interactive Learning Environments, pp. 1-13, (2020); Aguilera-Hermida A.P., College students’ use and acceptance of emergency online learning due to COVID-19, International Journal of Educational Research Open, 1, (2020); Aguilera-Hermida A.P., Quiroga-Garza A., Gomez-Mendoza S., Del Rio Villanueva C.A., Avolio Alecchi B., Avci D., Comparison of students’ use and acceptance of emergency online learning due to COVID-19 in the USA, Mexico, Peru, and Turkey, Education and Information Technologies, 26, 6, pp. 6823-6845, (2021); Akers R.L., Jennings W., Social learning theory, The handbook of criminological theory, 4, pp. 230-240, (2015); Alonso R.S., Prieto J., Garcia O., Corchado J.M., Collaborative learning via social computing, Frontiers of Information Technology and Electronic Engineering, 20, 2, pp. 265-282, (2019); Avolio B., Yammarino F.J., Bass B.M., Identifying common methods variance with data collected from a single source: An unresolved sticky issue, Journal of Management, 17, 3, pp. 571-587, (1991); Bainbridge K., Shute V., Rahimi S., Liu Z., Slater S., Baker R.S., D'Mello S.K., Does embedding learning supports enhance transfer during game-based learning?, Learning and Instruction, 77, (2022); Barroso C., Cepeda-Carrion G.A., Roldan J.L., Applying maximum likelihood and PLS on different sample sizes: Studies on SERVQUAL model and employee behavior model, Handbook of partial least squares.

The objective of this study was to measure the effect of participation in an Instagram-based educational game on learning outcomes. Method: Experimental design with 291 university students in a first-year course of the Bachelor of Nursing during the 2020–21 academic year. Results: After ruling out pretest sensitization, we identified a positive effect of participation in the educational game. An average improvement of 0.62 points was observed in the final grade of the students belonging to the experimental groups. Conclusion: Nursing undergraduate students participating an Instagram-based educational game had better learning outcomes than their counterparts who did not participate in the game. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Game-based learning; Gamification; Higher education; Instagram; Nursing students,"Education, Nursing, Baccalaureate; Educational Measurement; Educational Status; Humans; Learning; Students, Nursing; article; experimental design; experimental study; game-based learning; gamification; human; human experiment; learning; major clinical study; nursing student; outcome assessment; sensitization; social media; tertiary education; undergraduate student; university student; education; educational status; nursing education; procedures",,,,,"University of Barcelona Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences; Universitat de Barcelona, UB","Funding text 1: We would like to thank the Department of Fundamental Nursing and Medical-Surgical Nursing of the University of Barcelona for supporting this project and its implementation.

Simultaneously, studies on the use of gamification techniques have emerged in diverse fields, including computer science, education, and healthcare. Despite the broad popularity of gamification in other fields, it has received only limited attention in the service literature. Moreover, the findings of extant studies on gamification in the service field are inconclusive and suggest an incomplete understanding of the employment of gamification in service contexts. Thus, this study aims to integrate the growing but scattered cross-disciplinary literature on gamification and to emphasize its relevance to service research. Specifically, we first conceptualize gamification for service and differentiate it from related concepts. Then, using a systematic literature review, we identify 34 empirical articles that reflect this gamification conceptualization and can be connected to relevant service research themes (e.g., customer participation, experience, and loyalty). Employing activity theory, we derive four higher-order functions of gamification: production, consumption, exchange, and distribution. Finally, we develop a research agenda to generate a better understanding of the central aspects within each of the identified gamification functions and stimulate future academic efforts on gamification in services. © The Author(s) 2022.",activity theory; engagement; experience; gamification; loyalty; systematic literature review,,,,,,,,"Agarwal R., Karahanna E., Time Flies When You're Having Fun: Cognitive Absorption and Beliefs About Information Technology Usage, MIS Quarterly, 24, 4, pp. 665-694, (2000); Alhammad M.M., Moreno A.M., Gamification in Software Engineering Education: A Systematic Mapping, Journal of Systems and Software, 141, July, pp. 131-150, (2018); Allen D.K., Brown A., Karanasios S., Norman A., How Should Technology-Mediated Organizational Change be Explained?

In this study we present an analysis of two approaches used in consecutive years on two modules. A traditional flipped learning approach “standard learning” where material is released weekly online and there are supporting tutorials and an end of term assessment; and a “structured active learning” strategy where a more scaffolded approach is applied, requiring participation to progress. In this approach students’ work on the virtual learning environment and in tutorials could be used to contribute towards their end of term assessment (no more than 10% of the module credit), connected to a learning outcome on the breadth or range of topics. Students received feedback in rubric form throughout the topic, to see their progression. It was found that for module 1, over 90% of the students had accessed the pre-released material by week 2 in the structured active learning approach while this level of engagement was only reached in week 5 using the standard approach. Participation in learning events was far better using the structured active learning approach when compared to the standard approach, for example rising from 40% to 78% in week 2. The second module, with a different cohort of students, followed similar trends with the active learning approach attracting higher levels of engagement and participation far earlier in the term. Following the increased engagement, the structured active learning approach was beneficial in assessment with improved grade profiles. © 2022 The Author(s)",Active learning; Assessment; Engagement; Flipped learning; Gamification; Participation,"Education, Distance; Feedback; Humans; Problem-Based Learning; article; gamification; human; human experiment; learning; outcome assessment; virtual learning environment; education; feedback system; problem based learning",,,,,,,"Brame C.J.; O'Flaherty J., Phillips C., The use of flipped classrooms in higher education: a scoping review, Internet Higher Educ., 1, 25, pp. 85-95, (2015); Blaschke L.M., Heutagogy and lifelong learning: A review of heutagogical practice and self-determined learning, Int.

An experimental method with a pretest–post-test design was considered, in which the control group followed a transmission instructional model, and the experimental group underwent an eight-session gamified experience using Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). Four ad hoc tests were designed and implemented to assess writing, reading, speaking, and listening skills, while various test adaptations were used to measure attention and motivation variables. The results show that gamification helped to improve the variables analyzed, showing significant enhancements in reading from the experimental group, as well as a more positive attitude towards the English subject, increased active participation, and fewer negative inclinations towards mistakes. The study suggests that incorporating gamification can have a positive impact on learning outcomes and may serve as a means of bridging linguistic inequalities and promoting equitable access to language learning opportunities. However, further research is necessary to explore the potential of gamification in this regard. © 2023 by the author.",affective factors; attention; English as a Second Language; experimental research; gamification; ICT; linguistic competence; motivation,,,,,,"Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha, UCLM",This investigation has been developed thanks to the funding and support received by UCLM.,"Toro A., Arguis M., Metodologías activas, A Tres Bandas, 38, pp. 69-77, (2015); Mendez Z., Aprendizaje y Cognición, (2005); Sarramona J., Teoría de la Educación, (2008); Hidalgo-Bonilla R., Los Juegos de Integración en el Desarrollo Social de la Escuela Básica General Juan Lavalle.

The general aim of this study is to provide a set of gamification design principles for researchers and practitioners on how gamification can be used in online and distance learning programs in higher education. More specifically, the study intended to seek the answers whether student participation in the online and distance learning programs can be increased by the use of gamification, how the gamification influences the students’ academic performances in the online and distance learning programs and what learners think about integrating gamification into the open and distance learning programs in higher education. The study was designed as a sequential exploratory research, which is one of the mixed research methods. Findings indicate that integrating gamification into the online and distance learning programs has a significant impact on increasing students' visits to the learning environment. In addition, when the pre-gamification and post-gamification scenarios were compared in terms of students accessing to the content in the online and distance learning environment, it was discovered that there was a statistically significant increase. It can be also said that there is significant difference regarding to academic performances for gamified situations. Lastly, gamification is said to be fun by students and to contribute positively to their motivation. According to this, gamification has a positive effect on learners' e-learning behaviors and should be used more in online and distance learning programs. © 2022, Serious Games Society.

Nontechnical skills, such as those encompassed by crisis resource management principles, are essential when working in these situations. Used commercially for entertainment, escape rooms have recently been utilised by clinical educators to teach both technical and nontechnical skills. Objective: This exploratory study evaluates how advanced clinicians, intensive care outreach nurses, experience an escape room scenario designed to consolidate crisis resource management (CRM) principles. Methods: Three escape room sessions were conducted in a 1038-bed metropolitan tertiary referral hospital. A purposive sample of 12 intensive care outreach nurses were invited to participate. The participant's experience of the escape room scenario was determined by their responses to a post–escape room survey and focus group discussion. Transcripts of the audio recordings from focus group discussions were analysed using an inductive coding approach. Results: Two primary categories emerged from analysis of the focus group discussions: (i) the clinicians’ experiences of the escape room and (ii) CRM principles. The first category included descriptions of emotions, including confusion, frustration, and a dislike for puzzles. The second category included both the participants understanding of the CRM principles, and how the principles influence the work within the escape room. Conclusions: Escape rooms have shown promise as novel educational environments, which challenge participants. Despite initial negative descriptions of the escape room, focus group discussions demonstrated that the participants were able to recognise the impact of CRM principles and acknowledge how these affect their clinical work in an ad hoc team. © 2023 Australian College of Critical Care Nurses Ltd",Crisis resource management; Escape room; Gamification; Intensive care outreach nurse; Nontechnical skills; Nursing education,adult; article; audio recording; controlled study; emotion; exploratory research; female; frustration; gamification; genetic transcription; human; human experiment; intensive care; male; nurse; nursing education; pilot study; purposive sample; resource management; skill; tertiary care center,,,,,,,"Australian commission on safety and quality in health care, (2019); Gaba D.M., Fish K.J., Howard S.K., Crisis management in anesthesiology, (1994); Murphy M., Curtis K., McCloughen A., What is the impact of multidisciplinary team simulation training on team performance and efficiency of patient care?

However, DRR initiatives often find a deadlock when introduced to informal and unplanned settlements due to a lack of participation, trust, and knowledge among stakeholders. To this background, gamification seems to have the potential as a disaster communication and education tool for engaging informal dwellers in DRR action. This study extends the conceptual application of the “stop disasters!” game that includes achievement, report/feedback system, role-play features, spatial/environmental representation, and overlay features with incentives/disincentives policies. We applied an experimental game design approach based on an extensive literature review of actionable gamification for DRR and disaster education. Engaging with several stakeholders through role-playing features allows urban and safety planners, city authorities, and disaster researchers to understand the decision-making behavior and motivation vital for formulating DRR policies. Furthermore, the enhanced game design elements of stop game disasters suggest raising urban citizens’ motivation, awareness, and participation, including marginalized communities, in an inclusive DRR and climate resilience planning. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Community resilience; Disaster risk reduction; Gamification in DRR initiatives; Role-playing; “Stop Disasters!” game,Decision making; Floods; Game design; Motivation; Community resiliences; Disaster risk reductions; Game design; Gamification; Gamification in disaster risk reduction initiative; Informal settlements; Role playing; Urban citizens; “stop disaster!” game; Disasters,,,,,,,"Matyas D., Pelling M., Positioning resilience for 2015: The role of resistance, incremental adjustment, and transformation in disaster risk management policy, Disasters, 39, pp. 1-19, (2014); Mochizuki J., Keating A., Liu W., Hochrainer-Stigler S., Mechler R., An overdue alignment of risk and resilience?

In the design and delivery of activities, educators seek ways to enhance student participation and learning with the goal of developing students’ collaborative practice capabilities. Traditionally, learning formats have largely maintained a clinical focus to enable students to learn with, from and about each other’s roles as health professionals. In recent years, escape rooms have emerged as an innovative teaching approach within interprofessional education. Utilising gamification, escape rooms require students to work collaboratively, employing teamwork, communication, conflict resolution and problem-solving skills to ‘escape’ a set scenario. This article explores our experience of using escape rooms as an interprofessional education strategy. Additionally, we report on trialling a non-clinical focus within the activity as an alternative means of educating students for collaborative practice. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",escape room; health; Interprofessional education; student,,,,,,,,"Adams V., Burger S., Crawford K., Setter R., Can you escape?

Today's smart classrooms offer unprecedented opportunities for advancing multimodal learning analytics and gamifying educational interactions to fit the needs of today's generation. Most research efforts which try to make technology compete with instructors continue to prove that technology, although having many undoubtable benefits for education, is not (yet) ready to replace personal instruction. Smart infrastructure and applications should rather empower instructors and augment students' learning experience seamlessly in naturalistic settings. In this paper, ClasScorer is proposed as an unobtrusive platform for gamifying smart classroom learning interactions to help instructors monitor and encourage student in-class participation. After an analysis of the current state of smart classroom research and user survey results are presented to show the need for this research direction, the proposed architecture and first prototype are described and demonstrated in different use case scenarios.  © 2022 IEEE.",Affective Computing; Classroom Response Systems; Gamification; Multimodal Learning Analytics; Smart Classroom,Engineering education; Learning systems; Affective Computing; Classroom response systems; Continuous monitoring; Gamification; Multi-modal learning; Multimodal learning analytic; Smart classroom; Student engagement; Student learning; Teaching strategy; Students,,,,,,,"Christenson S.L., Reschly A.L., Wylie C., Research on Student Engagement; Zhan Z., Wu Q., Lin Z., Cai J., Smart classroom environments affect teacher-student interaction: Evidence from a behavioural sequence analysis, Australasian Journal of Educational Technology, 37, 2, pp. 96-109, (2021); Rutkauskiene D., Gudoniene D., Maskeliunas R., Blazauskas T., The gamification model for e-learning participants engagement, Smart Education and E-Learning 2016, pp. 291-301, (2016); Shoukry L., Gobel S., Reasons and responses: A multimodal serious games evaluation framework, IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing, 8, 1, pp. 245-325, (2017); Zhang C., From face-to-face to screen-to-screen: CFL teachers' beliefs about digital teaching competence during the pandemic, International Journal of Chinese Language Teaching, 1, 1, pp. 35-52, (2020); Singh J., Steele K., Singh L., Fortune Business Insights, EdTech and Smart Classroom Market Forecast, pp. 2022-2029, (2021); Combining the best of online and face-to-face learning: Hybrid and blended learning approach for COVID-19, post vaccine, & postpandemic world, Journal of Educational Technology Systems, 50, 2, pp. 140-171; Mathioudakis G., Leonidis A., Korozi M., Margetis G., Ntoa S., Antona M., Stephanidis C., Real-time teacher assistance in technologically-augmented smart classrooms, Int.

The remote clerkship format provided advantages of allowing participation of students from more locations and greater scheduling flexibility but provided new challenges of maintaining learner engagement and providing experiential content of the laboratory environment. Gamification of educational content is one educational modality that has shown effectiveness in a multitude of different contexts to increase learner engagement and retention. Therefore, we created an interactive, educational 360° virtual reality walkthrough tour using off-the-shelf commercially available 360° cameras and software of the Transfusion service and Microbiology Laboratories. The process consists of taking multiple 360° still-images within the space, color-correction, blurring the faces of staff or sensitive information, adding navigation buttons, and other interactive elements. The virtual tours were used for both recruitment and education with further plans to integrate the learning modality into the curriculum. The clerkship is likely to remain as partially or fully as remote learning so such walkthrough tours will continue to remain relevant. This technology can be applied globally to other departments and institutions for education or recruitment. © 2022 AABB",,COVID-19; Curriculum; Humans; Laboratories; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Virtual Reality; Article; audio recording; autopsy; blood transfusion; career mobility; clinical education; clinical laboratory personnel; clinical practice; computer simulation; curriculum development; e-learning; gamification; human; image enhancement; image quality; interview; medical student; microbiology; pathology; positive feedback; problem solving; residency education; self report; telehealth; videoconferencing; virtual learning environment; virtual reality; web browser; curriculum; epidemiology; laboratory; pandemic,,,,,University of Washington Center for Leadership and Innovation in Medical Education,This was partly funded by an award from the University of Washington Center for Leadership and Innovation in Medical Education.

It is employed primarily to increase students' motivation by incorporating game elements into an otherwise didactic context. Research into the use of gamification in language teaching has focused largely on characterizing the specific practices involved and on determining the degree of motivation elicited in students. There has been little examination of students' perceptions of gamification or their assessment of its effectiveness for learning a modern language. This study analyses learner perception and motivation among a group of sixteen university students of Spanish as a modern foreign language following participation in a gamified learning experience. Analysis of the information gathered from student perception questionnaires and non-participant observation indicates that the students perceive progress in vocabulary learning but not in grammatical knowledge. The students also report a high level of motivation for the proposed learning activities due to the possibility of working collaboratively with their classmates. The article concludes with reflections on the relevance and didactic implications of gamification as a methodological strategy in modern foreign language teaching at higher education level.  © 2023 the author(s), published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston.",gamification; Higher Education; learner perception; motivation; Spanish as a modern foreign language,,,,,,,,"Alsawaier R., The effect of gamification on motivation and engagement, International Journal of Information and Learning Technology, 35, 1, pp. 56-79, (2018); Batlle J., Gonzalez M.V., Jugando con la formación continua: Percepciones de la gamificación a medio plazo en la enseñanza de lenguas extranjeras, Edunovatic 2020.

In 2020, an online survey aimed at university students (N=225) pointed the authors to various challenges related to well-being in terms of studying, socializing, community, and safety during the COVID-19 pandemic. These results shaped the crowdsensing-enabled service design of a mobile application, Tecnico GO!, aimed at supporting students' well-being. Considering the constant changing context caused by the pandemic, we present a study conducted during the academic year 2021-2022 and if/how the App's features continue to respond to student's needs. The evaluation of the App focused on 12 semi-structured interviews and think-aloud protocols. Findings cluster around three themes: a) Supporting the study experience; b) Building a sense of community; c) Improving gamification for better participation. Discussion elaborates on the student's perceptions around well-being during pandemics. Students' insights of the App are overall positive and highlight that crowdsensing-enabled design does contribute to learning, community and safety, but the gamification as currently deployed does not.  © 2022 ACM.",crowdsensing; design evaluation; social distancing; student well-being,COVID-19; Case-studies; Crowdsensing; Design evaluation; Gamification; Online surveys; Social distancing; Student well-being; University campus; University students; Well being; Students,,,,,"LARSyS, (UIDB/50009/2020); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, FCT",The project was supported by LARSyS (Projeto UIDB/50009/2020) and FCT (RESEARCH 4 COVID-19 2nd Edition – 344).,"WeHealth Arizona, (2022); Allas T., Chinn D., Erik Sjatil P., Zimmerman W., Well-being in Europe: Addressing the high cost of COVID-19 on life satisfaction, (2020); Beaunoyer E., Dupere S., Guitton M.J., COVID-19 and digital inequalities: Reciprocal impacts and mitigation strategies, Computers in Human Behavior, 111, (2020); Biernath A., Varíola dos macacos, hepatite misteriosa, covid: Mundo está mais propenso a surtos e epidemias?, (2022); Braun V., Clarke V., Using thematic analysis in psychology, Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3, 2, pp. 77-101, (2006); Brodeur A., Clark A.E., Fleche S., Powdthavee N., COVID-19, lockdowns and well-being: Evidence from Google Trends, Journal of Public Economics, 193, (2021); Brooks S.K., Webster R.K., Smith L.E., Woodland L., Wessely S., Greenberg N., James Rubin G., The psychological impact of quarantine and how to reduce it: Rapid review of the evidence, The Lancet, 395, pp. 912-920, (2020); Free COVID-19 Self-Screener and Fast Pass for Higher Ed, (2020); New University app lets students easily show their COVID-19 vaccination status, (2021); Cho H., Ippolito D., William Yu Y., Contact Tracing Mobile Apps for COVID-19: Privacy Considerations and Related Trade-offs, (2020); Javier Clemente-Suarez V., Navarro-Jimenez E., Jimenez M., Hormeno-Holgado A., Begona Martinez-Gonzalez M., Camilo Benitez-Agudelo J., Perez-Palencia N., Cecilia Laborde-Cardenas C., Francisco Tornero-Aguilera J., Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic in Public Mental Health: An Extensive Narrative Review, Sustainability, 13, 6, (2021); Collado-Borrell R., Escudero-Vilaplana V., Villanueva-Bueno C., Herranz-Alonso A., Sanjurjo-Saez M., Features and Functionalities of Smartphone Apps Related to COVID-19: Systematic Search in App Stores and Content Analysis, Journal of Medical Internet Research, 22, 8, (2020); Deznabi I., Motahar T., Sarvghad A., Fiterau M., Mahyar N., Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Academic Community Results from a Survey Conducted at University of Massachusetts Amherst, Digit.

However, more research is needed on how teachers use technology-enhanced learning tools and incorporate successful gamification strategies in their practice. Simultaneously, the use of digital platforms in formal education contexts has become highly hierarchical, giving teachers no room for creativity. Within the scope of design-based research, this study focuses on assessing the relevance of developing a gamified digital platform model aimed at assisting K-12 schools with the implementation of extracurricular projects, specifically regarding the promotion of participation, the recognition of skills and its users' sense of belonging to the corresponding educational community. A survey by questionnaire was publicly shared in June 2022 with the support of different Teachers' Associations to evaluate Portuguese K-12 schoolteachers' receptiveness to integrating such a digital platform model in their practice. A voluntary response sample including 215 valid responses was obtained, and data were analyzed through descriptive statistics and content analysis. According to the study findings, the relevance of developing such platform model was confirmed due to the innovativeness of its features and the lack of similar tools combining gamification strategies with the formal recognition of learners' attitudes and skills in K-12 education.  © 2023 IEEE.",digital platform; gamification; K-12 schools; relevance assessment,Digital platforms; Extracurricular activities; Gamification; K-12 schools; Learning tool; Platform models; Relevance assessments; Sense of belonging; Teachers'; Technology enhanced learning,,,,,,,"Dicheva D., Dichev C., Agre G., Angelova G., Gamification in education: A systematic mapping study, Educational Technology and Society, 18, 3, pp. 75-88, (2015); Hew S., K.F., Huang B., Does gamification improve student learning outcome?

This research is quantitative, in which we worked with university students from the leveling courses of mathematics and basic mathematics applied to different engineering careers. Initially, the students were evaluated, through the applicationof a survey to identify the reasons for their low academic performance, in this aspect it was observed that 72.5% of thestudent's state that they had a bad foundation in their respective schools. Then, the gamification tools were implemented in the description of the topics proposed in the syllabus and the influence on academic performance was analyzed, this implementation resulted in students being able to improve their academic performance, and 12.3% of students They were more motivated when carrying out the activities. Finally, the training was carried out for the teachers explaining how to use the gamification tools and how the evaluation should be carried out on the students, at this point it was observed that some teachers were unaware of technological tools to incorporate into the learning processof the students., but at the same time, they showed concern about updating themselves on the use of Tics and above all how to incorporate them into their class sessions. © 2023 Latin American and Caribbean Consortium of Engineering Institutions.

The study involved 35 last-year elementary school children, in Western Greece, with learning and behavioral issues. The children were given games with both practical and academic modules throughout their online schooling. For example, a math game was played over WebEx using Kahoot; a game for European institutions was created using the learningapps.org software; and online games from the European Union's ""Learning Corner""as well as the game ""Defeat the Virus""were used for the Social and Political Education topic. The findings are based on data collected through synchronous and asynchronous e-learning frameworks (WebEx, e-Class), and were linked to both cognitive learning aspects and school children active participation in online education using a standardized psychometric scale called ""Psychosocial Adaptation of Primary School Children.""The findings suggest that gamification might be a beneficial tool for improving children' cognitive performance in elementary school and generating a meaningful learning experience. The educational intervention aided young people in the development of assertiveness/leadership skills; interpersonal communication skills; social competence; and self-perception. The benefits of the online educational process include the enhancement of students' neurocognitive processes, particularly their executive functions, as well as their social competencies and interpersonal relationships.  © Author.",distance learning; gamification; neurocognitive parameters; school children; social function,,,,,,,,"Achenbach T.

Therefore, the teacher oversees making use of innovative strategies such as gamification together with technology as a support instrument in the teaching-learning of the various contents. The objective of this research is to determine the contribution provided by the Nearpod platform in virtual classes for Higher education students. Experimental research was applied with a parts approach through the application of two instruments that were validated by Cronbach's Alpha; they had a structure of questions with multiple choice on a Likert scale of five points, in addition to the application of the Technological Acceptance Model (TAM) to verify the level of acceptance of new technology or resource. The study population is 30 students of the Tourism Major of the Technical University of Ambato. For the validation of the hypothesis, the Friedman Chi-square statistic was applied to the most representative questions to determine which hypothesis to accept and finally check with the Kolmogorov Smirnov (KS) statistic, reaching the conclusion that the Nearpod platform as a gamification resource contributes to the teaching of university students in virtual classes, promoting inclusion, active participation, and collaborative work. It also allows the teacher to be the guide or mediator of the learning process and the student feels motivated and above all generates knowledge. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Academic performance; Author resources; Education; Gamification; Nearpod,Computational complexity; E-learning; Education computing; Engineering education; Academic performance; Author resource; Collaborative Work; Gamification; Higher education students; Nearpod; Teachers'; Technological tools; Virtual class; Virtual education; Students,,,,,,,"Sullivan P., Sergi-McBrayer J., Miller S., Fallon K., An Examination of the use of computer-based formative assessments, Comput.

Design thinking/case study, inquiry-based learning, project-based learning, gamification and distance learning are catching on in education systems around the world, enhancing students’ ability to retain information and acquire new skills. The International Student Challenge “UrbanFarm”, organized by the University of Bologna, has been an important opportunity to put these methodologies in place and observe and study their effects on students’ learning process. Multidisciplinary student teams, with members from different universities from all around the world, were asked to deliver innovative urban agricultural project proposals for the recovery of abandoned/vacant urban sites, by integrating architectural and technological innovations while pursuing social, environmental and economic sustainability. At present, while there are several international student challenges fostering student growth worldwide, and some followup surveys to assess their effect on participants were designed, disseminated and eventually analysed, there is a lack of scientific work addressing the real outcomes of such challenges. The hereby study aims to quantitatively assess how participation in UrbanFarm Challenge has affected students’ acquisition of new information, their ability to work within a multidisciplinary and international team, along with their future job perspectives. Furthermore, the study also assesses how the students’ experience in the Challenge was affected by the ongoing pandemics. Data are collected through an online survey circulated both to students from universities worldwide, including both UrbanFarm participants of all three editions (2019, 2020 and 2021) and other students that did not participate in UrbanFarm. © 2022 International Society for Horticultural Science.

(an online classroom response system) was acceptable and more effective at teaching pediatric residents musculoskeletal knowledge and skills than a nongamified curriculum. Methods: A prospective, randomized controlled trial was conducted at an urban, academic pediatric clinic. All participants received a curriculum that included brief didactics and knowledge questions. The knowledge questions were delivered via Kahoot! to the intervention group and administered via paper to the control group. The primary outcome was knowledge and skill acquisition following curriculum participation. Results: A total of 73 of 85 (86%) residents completed the study (intervention group: 46; control group: 27). Following participation in the curriculum, intervention and control residents demonstrated an improvement in musculoskeletal knowledge (P <. 05) measured via questionnaire, as well as an improvement in physical exam skills during a standardized patient encounter (P <. 05). There was no difference in knowledge or skill improvement between groups. Intervention participants indicated positive attitudes toward Kahoot!. Conclusions: Our musculoskeletal curriculum demonstrated improvements in knowledge and skills among residents, though inclusion of Kahoot! did not enhance the experimental effect. Further research is needed to identify strategies to optimize gamification for learning. © 2022 Academic Pediatric Association",gamification; Kahoot!; musculoskeletal knowledge; musculoskeletal skills,Child; Clinical Competence; Curriculum; Humans; Internship and Residency; Learning; Physical Examination; Prospective Studies; child; controlled study; curriculum; female; gamification; human; learning; male; note; outcome assessment; pediatric hospital; physical examination; prospective study; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; resident; skill; teaching; clinical competence; curriculum; medical education,,,,,APPD; Association of Pediatric Program; CCHMC,"Funding text 1: Financial statement: This project was supported by the Association of Pediatric Program Directors (APPD).

Our aim is to confirm the relationships between the patterns of accomplishment of the gamified activities and the network structure of the social graphs associated with the online forums with knowledge acquisition and final outcomes. For this purpose, we have offered two learning paths, traditional and novel, to our students. We have identified course variables that quantitatively explain the improvements reported when using the innovative methodologies integrated into the course design, and we have applied techniques from the social network analysis (SNA) and the machine learning/deep learning (ML/DL) domains to conduct success/failure classification methods finding that, generally, very good results are obtained when an ensemble approach is used, that is, when we blend the predictions made by different classifiers. The proposed methodology can be used over reduced datasets and variable time windows for having early estimates that allow pedagogical interventions. Finally, we have applied other statistical tests to our datasets, that confirm the influence of the learning path on learning results. © 2022 The Authors.

However, there is little research on using the same gamification elements in different settings. Therefore, we explore the different cognitive learning outcomes of participants in virtual and in-person gamified workshops. We developed a gamified workshop concept on sustainable transport logistics that was used for virtual and in-person settings in Austria. To ensure the quality of our workshops, we have introduced a pre-post experiment where learning effects are measured by a survey. The main findings show that gamification has proven to be a useful pedagogical strategy to achieve cognitive learning outcomes in in-person and virtual workshops. However, the cognitive learning outcome differs significantly between the participants of virtual vs. in-person gamified workshops. Our study shows that more attention needs to be paid to gamification in virtual vs. in-person settings to maximize the cognitive learning outcome of users with different demographic characteristics. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.",cognitive learning outcome; experiment; gamification in education; Gamified workshops; pre-post-survey; virtual vs. in-person,Cognitive learning; Cognitive learning outcome; Gamification; Gamification in education; Gamified workshop; In-person; Learning outcome; Online environments; Pre-post-survey; Virtual vs.; E-learning,,,,,,,"Barrera G, Benalcazar Ch D., San Lucas S, Gamification in the teaching of prevention measures for Covid-19, IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON), pp. 1512-1516, (2022); Gomez-Garcia G., Ramos-Navas-Parejo M., de La Cruz-Campos J.-C., Rodriguez-Jimenez C., Impact of COVID-19 on University Students: An Analysis of Its Influence on Psychological and Academic Factors, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 19, 16, pp. 1-2, (2022); Rincon-Flores E.G., Santos-Guevara B.N., Gamification during Covid-19: Promoting active learning and motivation in higher education, Australasian Journal of Educational Technology, 37, 5, pp. 43-60, (2021); Nieto-Escamez F.A., Roldan-Tapia M.D., Gamification as Online Teaching Strategy During COVID-19: A Mini-Review, FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY, 12, (2021); Park S., Kim S., Is Sustainable Online Learning Possible with Gamification?—The Effect of Gamified Online Learning on Student Learning, Sustainability, 13, 8, (2021); Jang J., Park J.J.Y., Yi M.Y., Gamification of Online Learning, Artificial Intelligence in Education, (2015); Looyestyn J., Kernot J., Boshoff K., Ryan J., Edney S., Maher C., Does gamification increase engagement with online programs?

Implementing gamification aspects in a course can also provide an opportunity to gather student data that would not have been available otherwise. This paper describes a data gathering process in the context of a university course, as a work-in-progress. Among these data there is information regarding the participation of students in quizzes presented as games in the classroom. These quizzes combined questions covering course con-tents, as well as some regarding self-regulated learning habits. The main advantage observed was a high student participation in the quizzes. As a result, this gamification approach proved to be a more effective way to gather student data compared to other methods applied in previous academic years, which often failed due to many students ignoring optional activities. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.",Data collection; gamification; learning analytics; self-regulated learning,Data acquisition; Data collection; Data gathering; Gamification; High educations; Learning analytic; Learning habits; Learning process; Self-regulated learning; Student participation; University course; Students,,,,,"Galician regional government; Xunta de Galicia - Conselleria de Educación, Universidade e Formación Profesional; European Commission, EC; European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, (ED431B 2020/33); Xunta de Galicia; Centro Singular de Investigación de Galicia, CINBIO, (2019-2022)","Funding text 1: This work is partially financed by public funds granted by the Galician regional government, with the purpose of supporting research activities carried out by PhD students.

Therefore, there has been a widespread search for learning methods that incorporate digital technologies and active student participation in recent years. Game-based learning may be an option, as it uses game-design elements to enhance academic performance and learning. Its use in nursing education is, however, limited. OBJECTIVES: The literature review aimed to explore student experience and learning when using game-based learning and to understand its uses in the nursing curriculum. DESIGN: Systematic literature review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: ESBCO Discovery Service was used to search healthcare, science and education-related databases. REVIEW METHODS: A comprehensive search of English language primary research published between 2017 and 2022 on the use of game-based learning in nursing undergraduate education was conducted. Data was analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Seventeen papers from 4 different countries were included. The studies explored interventions and subjects of increased teaching complexity that required increased levels of knowledge retention and critical thinking, such as nursing theory and complex clinical skills. Three themes emerged from the literature, including: approaches to game-based learning; student experience and engagement; impact of game-based learning on student learning and knowledge retention. Studies used a wide range of learning methods, such as quizzes, escape rooms and serious games. These methods were in general well-accepted by students, who endorsed its widespread use in the nursing curriculum. Most studies reported an increase in student experience and learning when using game-based learning, although time-limited games can often increase anxiety on students. CONCLUSIONS: Game-based learning is an important alternative to traditional teaching methods. However, the recurrent use of game elements and its limited long-term effects may pose a limitation to its widespread use in nursing undergraduate education. Copyright © 2022.

One such new pedagogical technique to increase motivation in young scholars is that of 'gamification.' Gamification is the process of taking elements from other forms of media (specifically those of board games or video games) and applying them in an academic setting. By incorporating these techniques, it aims to increase student participation and encouraging them to develop logistical skills or behaviors that are conducive to skilled learners. However, gamification is not an all-purpose solution that can be implemented haphazardly. This work discusses not only the potential gains when gamification is done properly, but also many of the pitfalls and potential issues that can arise when game mechanics are inserted into the collegiate classroom. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2023.",,Engineering education;

Foreigners who lack the necessary earthquake knowledge and escape skills may not survive strong earthquakes in Japan. Therefore, it is essential to provide earthquake education to these foreigners. Since rich-formed earthquake education has been available for foreigners living in Japan, this research works to improve the earthquake education situation for foreigners who intend to visit Japan. Receiving earthquake education in advance helps enhance foreigners’ earthquake risk awareness, gain more opportunities to master earthquake survival knowledge, and build earthquake survival confidence. This paper proposed a learning model called ‘FOE+G’ to achieve the research goals. ‘FOE’ means the frequency of occurrence of earthquakes in Japan, and ‘G’ means gamification. A prototype system in the form of a cross-platform application has been developed to confirm that the learning model improves earthquake education for the target audience. The application delivers an earthquake notification to target objects each time an eligible earthquake occurs in Japan. The High-frequency earthquakes in Japan lead to relatively frequent updates, which enable users to build earthquake awareness, realise the importance of earthquake education, and participate more actively in it. Furthermore, gamification is employed in the application to prompt participation in earthquake education. © 2022, International Journal of Interactive Mobile Technologies.

Thus, this article aims to explore and describe the design considerations of gamification and the factors that evidenced its success in engineering education. Therefore, a systematic review of the literature was developed under a mixed approach and with an exploratory-descriptive scope. The results showed that gamification was applied to a greater extent in computer engineering and software engineering. In addition, the design considerations that prevailed in the development of gamification applications were, to a greater extent. focused on the pedagogical objective and the interaction of the simulation. It was found that the application of gamification effectively generates motivation, commitment, and permanent participation of the student. As such, it is concluded that aspects such as the area of knowledge of the student in engineering are relevant for the implementation of gamification. In addition, the design considerations that contribute to the success of the construction of student learning do not depend on the virtual, face-to-face or hybrid teaching model; however, it is necessary to build regulations that regulate and promote the continuity and sustainability of the use of gamification throughout the engineering career and not in isolation.  ©2023 Authors.",design; engineering education; gamification; motivation; success factors,,,,,,,,"Abreu M.

Currently, many teachers use social networks to share supplementary course materials and student work, but they have not incorporated gamified educational activities into social networking sites. Objective: To determine nursing students' satisfaction with an Instagram-based educational game and their perceptions of its effects on their learning. Design: We conducted a cross-sectional, descriptive, observational study. Participants: First-year nursing students in the subject “Dietetics and Nutrition”. Results: Of the total sample, 71.7 % agreed that gamification had helped them assimilate the content. Between 66 % and 70 % agreed that the experience had motivated them to keep up with the subject and learn more about the topic, that it had helped them to better understand certain concepts of the subject, that they would recommend the experience to other students, and that they enjoyed the experience of playing a game while learning. 71.7 % of them were in favour of increased use of gamification in other subjects. Conclusions: The use of an Instagram-based educational game as a complement to in-class teaching was useful, enjoyable, and motivating for the acquisition of new knowledge. © 2022",Game-based learning; Gamification; Higher education; Instagram; Nursing students; Social media,"Cross-Sectional Studies; Education, Nursing, Baccalaureate; Gamification; Humans; Perception; Personal Satisfaction; Students, Nursing; adult; article; dietetics; female; game-based learning; gamification; human; human experiment; learning; male; nursing student; nutrition; observational study; perception; satisfaction; social media; teaching; tertiary education; cross-sectional study; nursing education; perception; satisfaction",,,,,"Ajuts de Recerca Escola d'Infermeria UB; Ajuts de Recerca Escola d’Infermeria UB, (PREI-UB /2021)","Funding text 1: This study has been funded partially by the “Ajuts de Recerca Escola d'Infermeria UB, (PREI-UB /2021)”.; Funding text 2: This study has been funded partially by the “ Ajuts de Recerca Escola d’Infermeria UB , ( PREI-UB /2021 )”.

This systematic review analyzes how the different gamification proposals have been evaluated in different areas of knowledge such as health sciences, exact sciences, social sciences and humanities. Eighty-five significant studies were identified through a search of ISI Web Of Science and SCOPUS. In this systematic review, the criteria established in the PRISMA 2020 statement were followed. Gamification has been placed in four areas of knowledge distributed in seven disciplines: Physical Education, Physiotherapy and Nutrition, Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry, Computer Science, Social Sciences, Natural Sciences and Linguistics, the evaluation processes and instruments that have been used in its implementation are different. The results on the scientific production are indicated, analyzing the characteristics of the gamified proposals, the design, method and cut of the research used, the motivational and learning results, as well as the quality of the scientific production in each educational discipline through the Scale of Evaluation of Scientific Articles (EACSH) by Lopez et al. (2019). The scale is made up of nineteen evaluation criteria specified in eight dimensions: Summary, introduction, methodology, results, discussion, references, appendices, style and format. It is concluded that the psychological variables that were most evaluated in the gamified proposals were learning and motivation, with all positive results. On the other hand, significant correlations were established between the evaluation instruments and the improvement of some psychological variable: Reflection and participation groups, questionnaires and motivation, interviews and attention, evaluation and performance tests, and surveys to improve satisfaction. The results are analyzed and discussed in each of the seven disciplines studied. © 2022 Ediciones Universidad de Salamanca.

Serious is considered the cyber game that its purpose exceeds entertainment. For this case study, the serious sport club management game was “Top Eleven”. The theoretical model that this study was based on, is Misfeldt’s “scenarios based learning” for the transformation of a serious game into an educational means. It includes dimensions that cover part of the sport management class content in the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, School of Physical Education and Sport Science. The transformation consisted of educational scenarios vested to the serious game, in order to add educational parameters to its basic elements with the purpose to relate further to the sport management class. The application showed that Top Eleven covers adequately Misfeldt’s model dimensions; therefore it can be used as an educational tool. Furthermore, an evaluation of the class gamification was conducted by the participating students (n = 62). The data collected showed that the majority of the students (f = 61, 98.4%) agreed that the participation in the serious game was “helpful” to their sport management class education process. They further agreed that they gained “very” or “very much” knowledge related to the management of a professional soccer club (f = 41, 66.1%) and that 59.7% (f = 37) of them would choose to work in a position of “sport club manager” as a result of the experience they gained by participating in the serious game. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.",Gamification in higher education; Scenario based learning; Serious games for learning; Sport management games,Education computing; Simulation platform; Sports; Students; Games for learning; Gamification; Gamification in high education; High educations; Management games; Scenario based learning; Serious game for learning; Sport management game; Sport managements; Sports clubs; Serious games,,,,,,,"Afthinos I., Sport administration: The structure and functioning of sports organizations.

Design/methodology/approach: To capture the impact of gamification on student experience and student learning during and after the Covid-19 pandemic, data were collected through online surveys with L6 undergraduate students studying during the academic years 2020–2021, 2021–2022 and 2022–2023. Findings: The analysis of the data revealed three core themes: a) gaining practical experience through gamification b) opportunities for peer engagement and active participation and c) development of soft skills and hard skills. Practical implications: Based on the lessons learnt, the paper proposes actions and guidelines for integrating gamification into business management curricula that prepare future business managers and leaders to respond to unforeseen challenges and changes. Originality/value: This study contributes to a series of design suggestions for fellow tutors and practitioners seeking to advance their pedagogical approach to developing agile and resilient future managers and leaders. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Active learning;

It implies some hard-to-train skills such as abstraction and communication. Teachers, project leaders, and tool vendors have a hard time teaching or training their students, co-workers, or users. Gamification refers to the exploitation of gaming mechanisms for serious purposes, like promoting behavioral changes, soliciting participation and engagement in activities, etc. We investigate the introduction of gaming mechanisms in modeling tasks with the primary goal of supporting learning/training. The result has been the realization of a gamified modeling environment named PapyGame. In this article, we present the approach adopted for PapyGame implementation, the details on the gamification elements involved, and the derived conceptual architecture required for applying gamification in any modeling environment. Moreover, to demonstrate the benefits of using PapyGame for learning/training modeling, a set of user experience evaluations have been conducted. Correspondingly, we report the obtained results together with a set of future challenges we consider as critical to make gamified modeling a more effective education/training approach. © 2023, The Author(s).",Education; Gamification; Model-based engineering; Papyrus,Education computing; Learning systems; Behavioral changes; Engineering environment; Gamification; Model-based engineering; Modeling environments; Papyrus; Project leaders; Project tools; Teachers'; Workers'; Personnel training,,,,,,,"Suran S., Pattanaik V., Draheim D., Frameworks for collective intelligence: a systematic literature review, ACM Comput.

The environmental consciousness of communities as well as individual responsibility for the development of sustainable waste management strategies increased in demand, from urban planners and stakeholders to industries and business model developers. Despite this growing interest, the principal barrier to the implementation of sustainable waste management plans for the promotion of responsible production and consumption as well as the integration of Circular Economy into urban, industrial or otherwise environmentally compromised settings, remains the lack of knowledge and awareness of the benefits of sustainability as well as the active participation on behalf of the public, leading to a limited responsiveness to the individual social, economic and environmental responsibilities. The aim of this short communication is to explore the social factors that affect the transition towards circular economy. As social influence is in many cases overlooked, observation, identification, evaluation, and monitoring of social factors that have the potential to aid or delay circular transition is of imminent importance. At the same time, in line with the digital transition of today's society, the authors explore how digitalization can help with influencing the public in terms of environmental and sustainable education, social responsibility and other main areas of interest. The combination of existing educational models (i.e. gamification) where digitalization is also promoted is deemed very helpful to promote a sustainable way of thinking. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Circular economy; Social behavior; Strategies; Waste management,article; economic aspect; education; educational model; gamification; human; human experiment; social aspect; social attitude; social behavior; social responsibility; thinking; waste management,,,,,Department of Civil Engineering of the University of Salerno; Laboratory of Chemical Engineering and Engineering Sustainability of the Open University of Cyprus; Sanitary Environmental Engineering Division; University of the Aegean,"The authors would like to acknowledge the Laboratory of Chemical Engineering and Engineering Sustainability of the Open University of Cyprus, the Waste Management Laboratory of the Department of the Environment from the University of the Aegean as well as the Sanitary Environmental Engineering Division, Department of Civil Engineering of the University of Salerno.","Abad-Segura E., Gonzalez-Zamar M.-D., Infante-Moro J.C., Ruiperez Garcia G., Sustainable management of digital transformation in higher education: global research trends, Sustainability, (2020); Afroz R., Tudin R., Hanaki K., Masud M.M., Selected socio-economic factors affecting the willingness to minimise solid waste in Dhaka city, Bangladesh, J.

Gamified processes do not have to be computerized, but if they are, the software systems used during them typically share a host of specific characteristics putting them on a separate shelf, typically as a subtype of information systems. This creates the demand for specialised development methodologies that would merge traditional software life cycle with gamification processes. At the same time, it is known that the level of user participation, which is highly critical for gamified systems, depends significantly on the usability of the system. In this paper, we present a generalized gamified systems development methodology and its extended version that emphasizes high usability of the final product. To achieve it, actions must be taken both during the requirements specification, when the game components and usability requirements can be chosen based on the parameters of the given gamification project, and during evaluation of intermediate or final results of the development.  © 2023 ITMA.",gamification; gamified information systems; software development process; usability,Information use; Life cycle; Software design; Usability engineering; Development methodology; Gamification; Gamified information system; Software development process; Software life cycles; Software-systems; System development; System development methodologies; Usability; User participation; Information systems,,,,,,,"Deterding S., Dixon D., Khaled R., Nacke L., From game design elements to gamefulness: defining ""gamification, , Proceedings of the 15th international academic MindTrek conference: Envisioning future media environments, pp. 9-15, (2011); Magylaite K., Ceponiene L., Jurgelaitis M., Danikauskas T., A case study of applying gamification in teaching project management, Information and Software Technologies: 26th International Conference, ICIST 2020, pp. 321-333, (2020); Handayani V., Budiono F.L., Rosyada D., Amriza R.N., Masruroh S.U., Gamified learning platform analysis for designing a gamification-based ui/ux of e-learning applications: A systematic literature review, 2020 8th International Conference on Cyber and IT Service Management (CITSM), (2020); Magylaite K., Kaponius K., Butleris R., Ceponiene L., Towards High Usability in Gamified Systems: A Systematic Review of Key Concepts and Approaches, Applied Sciences, 12, (2022); Jordan P.W., An Introduction to Usability, pp. 5-23, (2020); Durmaz T.B., Fuertes J.L., Imbert R., Toward usability testing of motivational affordances through gamification, International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction, pp. 1-17, (2023); Morschheuser B., Hassan L., Werder K., Hamari J., How to design gamification?

In the current blended learning environment, there is a general lack of student participation and interaction in online learning, which in turn leads to low motivation and low learning outcomes. Therefore, under the guidance of constructivism and game-based teaching theories, this study constructs a game-based teaching model in the context of blended learning; and uses questionnaires and experimental research methods to investigate and analyse students' intrinsic motivation and concentration in the process of game-based teaching, in order to verify the effectiveness of the model. The study shows that the use of the model can effectively enhance students' intrinsic motivation and classroom concentration, and provide reference for teachers to conduct blended teaching and improve the quality of learning.  © 2023 ACM.",Blended learning; Concentration; Game-based instructional design; Intrinsic motivation,Computer aided instruction; Education computing; Learning systems; Motivation; Blended learning; Concentration; Design and application; Game-Based; Game-based instructional design; Gamification; Instructional designs; Intrinsic motivation; Teaching applications; Teaching designs; Students,,,,,"ACSI, (YWYB-2022-02, YWZDWT-2022-02); Game Collaboration for Primary School Science Curriculum, (YWYB-2022-26); Sichuan Research Center for Quality Development","This study was supported by the Sichuan Research Center for Quality Development of Compulsory Education on three topics, Research on the Innovative Mechanism of Online Teaching and Research for Compulsory Education Teachers Based on ACSI(YWZDWT-2022-02) , Research on the Design and Application of Hybrid Synchronous Learning Environment in the Perspective of Educational Metaverse(YWYB-2022-02) and Research on the Learning and Application of Game Collaboration for Primary School Science Curriculum (YWYB-2022-26).","SBrom C., Preuss M., Klement D., Are educational computer micro-games engaging and effective for knowledge acquisition at high-schools?

Modern technology has made it possible for new computer-based technological strategies like gamification. The pedagogical framework is based on the “gamification” game format, which is one of the most recent teaching strategies and has an engaging component for students. Gamification, flipped learning, and problem-based learning are three examples of the technical aspect of escape rooms. In the academic setting, gamification aims to boost student engagement and motivation in order to produce a better user experience. Gamification has been found to increase levels of participation, foster it, and improve activity outcomes. Gamification is recommended in educational settings to improve students’ achievement, focus, and contentment in light of these benefits. In order to establish an effective learning environment where students may effectively improve their learning capacities and boost their performance, it can be difficult to select a higher performing technique among the available techniques due to the ongoing use of gamification techniques. The fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) and evaluation based on distance from average solution (EDAS) are applied in order to determine the criterion weighting and assess the techniques in order to make a good decision. The presented paper analyzed numerous game-based learning techniques along with their applications in the educational field. Additionally, ten criteria and eight gamification methodologies are used to assess and pick the prior pertinent works. By utilizing the suggested approaches, the decision problem has been resolved. The FAHP approach is used in the suggested analysis to evaluate the criteria and determine their weights. Then, using the EDAS method, places are assigned to the chosen procedures based on their evaluation score and criterion weighting. The results of the appraisal show that the gamification technique with the highest production takes first place and is regarded as the best-performing and most successful technique. On the other hand, it is clear that the technique with the lowest production takes the bottom spot and is referred to as the least expensive and lowest performing technique. In order to increase students’ motivation, which could have a substantial impact on learning, it has been discovered that gamification is a feasible strategy. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",EDAS; FAHP; Flipped learning; Gamification; Higher education; Learning abilities; MCDM,Computer aided instruction; Engineering education; Motivation; Students; Cutting edge technology; EDAS; Flipped learning; Fuzzy analytical hierarchy process; Gamification; High educations; High school students; Learning abilities; MCDM; Student motivation; Learning systems,,,,,,,"Abu-Dawood S., The cognitive and social motivational affordances of gamification in E-learning environment, In: 2016 IEEE 16Th International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies (ICALT), Austin, pp. 373-375, (2016); Ahmad A., Zeshan F., Khan M.S., Marriam R., Ali A., Samreen A., The impact of gamification on learning outcomes of computer science majors, ACM Trans Comput Educ, 20, 2, (2020); Alshammari M.T., Evaluation of gamification in e-learning systems for elementary school students, TEM J, 9, 2, (2020); Broer J., Breiter A., Potentials of gamification in learning management systems: a qualitative evaluation, (2015); Cunha G.C.A., Barraqui L.P., Freitas S.A.A.D., Evaluating the use of gamification in mathematics learning in primary school children, In: 2018 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE), San Jose, Pp, pp. 1-4, (2018); Ferriz-Valero A., Osterlie O., Garcia Martinez S., Garcia-Jaen M., Gamification in physical education: evaluation of impact on motivation and academic performance within higher education, Int J Environ Res Public Health, (2020); Ibanez M.B., Delgado-Kloos D.S.A.C., Gamification for engaging computer science students in learning activities: a case study, IEEE Trans Learn Technol, 7, 3, pp. 291-301, (2014); Khaleel F.L., Ashaari N.S., Wook T.S.M.T., Ismail A., User-enjoyable learning environment based on Gamification elements, In: 2015 International Conference on Computer, Communications, and Control Technology (I4CT), Kuching, Pp, pp. 221-226, (2015); Gamification-based learning framework for a programming course, In: 2017 6Th International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics (ICEEI), Langkawi, pp. 1-6, (2017); Klock A.C.T., Ogawa A.N., Gasparini I., Pimenta M.S., Does gamification matter?

However, current teaching and evaluation methodologies are incorporating dynamic techniques that allow greater student participation in the learning process. It is essential that the classic model of education adapts to the changes in society and uses proper tools to encourage motivation in the education process. Gamification approaches generate motivation in the students and can lead to enhance the learning processes and outcomes. These strategies offer an alternative that is being used increasingly in higher education. Therefore, in this study, we developed a gamification strategy to generate motivation and engagement in engineering students. The strategy is applied in different courses and both in traditional and remote modalities. The validation of the proposal was carried out through a diagnostic tool in the form of a survey applied to the students of the courses where the gamified strategies were implemented. From these results we concluded that the gamified strategy helped to increase the motivation and engagement of the students, generating greater participation in the academic activities. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC",classroom engagement; engineering education; formative evaluation; gamification; teaching–learning process,Education computing; Engineering education; Learning systems; Motivation; Teaching; 'current; Case-studies; Classroom engagement; Formative evaluation; Gamification; High educations; Motivation and engagements; Teaching-learning method; Teaching-learning process; Students,,,,,,,"Akpolat B.S., Slany W., pp. 149-153, (2014); Alhammad M.M., Moreno A.M., Gamification in software engineering education: A systematic mapping, J.

Robotic surgery is gaining popularity in general surgery but requires specialized technical skills. We sought to determine whether gamification of robotic simulation training could increase robotic simulator utilization among general surgery residents. Methods: General surgery residents were recruited and sent weekly progress on simulator performance including leaderboards for 4 weeks during the intervention periods. There were also two control periods setup in an ABAB study design. Usage time and mean scores were compared between the control periods and intervention periods. A post-study qualitative assessment interview using semi-structured interviews determined barriers and motivational components of simulator usage. Results: Fifteen general surgery residents enrolled in the study (n = 15). Intervention increased total simulator usage time 9.7-fold from 153 to 1485 min. Total simulator days increased threefold from 9 to 27 days. Resident participation increased from 33 to 53%. Median average scores were higher during the intervention periods (58.8 and 81.9 vs 44.0). During the first intervention period, median individual-level simulator usage time increased 17 min (P = 0.03). However, there was no individual-level increase in median usage minutes or days during the second intervention period. Qualitative assessment determined barriers to be limited time due to clinical duties, and simulator availability while motivational factors included competitive factors such as leaderboards and gaming aspects. Potential improvements were increasing attending visibility of scores to increase recognition of progress by the residents and creating dedicated time for training. Conclusion: Gamification of robotic simulation training increased general surgery resident participation, usage time and scores. Impact was not durable. Instituting dedicated practice time and more attending engagement may increase trainee motivation and performance. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Gamification; Resident training; Robotic surgery; Simulation; Surgical education; Virtual reality,Academies and Institutes; Computer Simulation; Gamification; Humans; Robotic Surgical Procedures; Robotics; adult; Article; controlled study; curriculum; gamification; general surgery; human; normal human; residency education; resident; robot assisted surgery; semi structured interview; simulation training; surgical training; virtual reality; computer simulation; organization; robotics,,,da Vinci,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH, (UL1 TR002541); National Center for Research Resources, NCRR; Foundation for Ichthyosis and Related Skin Types, FIRST; National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NCATS; Harvard University; Harvard Catalyst; Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons, SAGES","Funding text 1: This work was conducted with funding provided by The SAGES Investigative Robotic Surgery Grant Award.

The review of the related literature indicates that there is a plethora of research on the implications of gamification in various fields. However, to the best of the researcher, these studies have not been synthesized yet. The main purpose of the study was to synthesize the relevant studies through a qualitative meta-analysis study. In so doing, different electrical database sources, including Google Scholar, Academia, Linked-in, Research gate, etc. were searched for the keywords: gamification, gamification implication, gamified* participation, etc. The data of the study were synthesized thorough qualitative meta-analysis. The findings were thematically analyzed and coded. Results showed that gamification has implications in education, e-learning, commerce, management, citizen participation, and motivation. The findings can be used by urban planners to provide citizens with playgrounds to play different games. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",Gamification; Motivation; Playable cities; Smart city; Vitality and citizenship participation,Commerce; Motivation; Smart city; Urban planning; Citizen participation; Citizen science; Google scholar; Meta analysis; Urban planners; database; meta-analysis; play; smart city; urban planning; Gamification,,,,,,,"Alawadhi S., Scholl H.J., Janssen M., Wimmer M.A., Moe C.E., Flak L.S., Aldama-Nalda A., Chourabi H., Gil-Garcia J.R., Leung S., Mellouli S., Nam T., Pardo T.A., Walker S., Building understanding of smart city initiatives: Electronic government, (2012); Albino V., Berardi U., Dangelico R., Smart cities: Definitions, dimensions, performance, and initiatives, Journal of Urban Technology, 22, pp. 75-98, (2015); Ampatzidou C., Gugerell K., Constantinescu T., Devisch O., Jauschneg M., Berger M., All work and no play: Facilitating serious games and gamified applications in participatory urban planning and governance, Urban Planning, 3, 1, pp. 34-46, (2018); Angelakis V., Tragos E., Pohls H.C., Kapovits A., Bassi A., Designing, developing, and facilitating smart cities: Urban dDesign to IOT solutions, (2017); Barata G., Gama S., Fonseca M., Goncalves D., Improving student creativity with gamification and virtual worlds.

In Spring 2021, each of these two courses was gamified by making regular course assignments and project Main Quests, offering optional tasks as Side Quests/LogicCoin Challenges for students to complete in order to earn rewards in the form of tokens (Gold or Coins), and setting up an Item Shop that students could purchase various items from using their tokens to gain small motivational benefits. The optional tasks were designed to provide students (and their peers) with opportunities to gain a better understanding of the course material, practice applying the course concepts more, and reflect on their learning and mistakes from quizzes/exams. The item shop provides the students with small benefits they can “purchase” with their collected tokens, such as Crystal Ball that when used, the student gets the opportunity to receive instructor feedback on a course project report before their final submission. A survey instrument that measures student motivation based on the Situational Motivation Scale (SIMS) [1-2] was administered to the consented participants in both classes at the end of the semester to assess the impact of this gamification on student motivation and success in these courses. A focus group discussion was also conducted at the end of the semester to better understand participants' initial reactions to gamification, their motivation for participation in gamification, and their overall opinions and suggestions towards gamification and its implementation. Based on quantitative analysis of the survey responses, it was found that students mostly correlate to identified regulation in terms of motivation of participation. Different demographics were analyzed to see how motivational factors may differ, and it is concluded that all categories of students from different academic standings, to gender identity, to course level all identified with participating due to identified regulation. The exception to note between those categories was the amount of participation from lower-performing students versus high-performing students, which suggests that lower-performing students were not as motivated as other groups. Qualitative analysis of the free responses survey questions and the focus group discussions showed that students felt relief from stress and anxiety with this approach of gamification because it allowed for contingency plans when student performance was individually impacted. Students reported that the gamified features made the courses more enjoyable and helped them learn material better than traditional assessments. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022",,Curricula; Engineering education; Motivation; Stress relief; Surveys; Arizona state university; Design course; Digital designs; Focus groups; Gamification; Group discussions; Mechanical design; Student motivation; Student success; Technical course; Students,,,,,,,"Guay F., Vallerand R.

Game-based learning (GBL) has been gradually used for education, and several innovations have emerged. The emergence of serious games and gamification provides alternative approaches for educators to improve the medical teaching process. Both serious games and gamification exert their education-promoting function by providing the possibility of combining learning activities such as feedback, testing, and spaced repetition with active participation and autonomy as well as positive experiences for students. Developing effective GBL modalities has the potential to bring immersive experiences for medical students and improve their study outcomes. Herein, we reviewed recent studies employing GBL in medical education, including serious games and gamification teaching. Furthermore, we also discussed the effectiveness and limitations of GBL to suggest future directions for the development and application of GBL in medical education.

It is very apparent that libraries are not actively trying to increase the interest and participation of users by applying the various angles or elements associated with gamification. By its very nature, gamification is the application of game-playing elements such as point scoring, peer competition, team work, score tables, and such used to motivate participants and make them more engaged with the subject matter. In areas such as education, marketing, and exercise, the implementation of gamification techniques is actively taking place in order to maximum participation by taking advantage of uncertainties or the competitive nature that many people have with the setting of goals. In this study, four libraries that have applied gamification are analyzed to understand how and to what degree gamification has been applied. Broken down into four different elements, this includes: Point, Reward, Leaderboards & Competition, Self-expression & Achievement. By focusing on the results of this analysis, gamification measures that can be applied to other libraries are specifically proposed. The overall results of this study will provide useful guidance and potential plans for libraries seeking to increase the number of users by using gamification to increase user participation and/or satisfaction with additional library services. © Seong-Kwan Lim, 2023",case study; gamification; Korea; library service; playing; United States of America,,,,,,,,"Play the 2021 summer game, (2021); Bigdeli Z., Haidari G., HajiYakhchali A., BasirianJahromi R., Gamification in library websites based on motivational theories, Webology, 13, 1, (2016); Bolz N., Wer nicht spielt, ist krank: Warum fußball, glücksspiel und social games lebenswichtig für uns sind [Who doesn’t play is sick: Why football, gambling, and social games are vital to us], (2014); Gamification 101: An introduction to the use of game dynamics to influence behavior, (2010); Caillois R., Les jeux et les hommes: Le masque et le vertige, (2014); Dichev C., Dicheva D., Gamifying education: What is known, what is believed and what remains uncertain: A critical review, International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education, 14, (2017); Deterding S., Dixon D., Khaled R., Nacke L., From game design elements to gamefulness: Defining “gamification”, Proceedings of the 15th International Academic MindTrek Conference: Envisioning Future Media Environments (MindTrek ‘11), pp. 9-15, (2011); What is gamification?, (2022); Gartner’s gamification predictions for 2020, (2014); Huizinga J., Homo ludens: A study of the play-element in culture, (1955); Kim Deuk Shin’s reading marathon, (2022); Kapp K.

BPMN modeling is present in different curricula in specific Master's Degree courses related to software engineering, but, in practice, students often underperform on BPMN modeling exercises due to difficulties in learning good modeling practices. In recent years, more and more fields of computer science have employed gamification (the usage of game elements in non-recreational contexts to gain benefits in terms of interest, participation, motivation, and enjoyment) with positive results during both development and teaching processes. Thus, we have developed a platform for BPMN modeling that employs gamification mechanics to facilitate learning good modeling practices with mechanisms such as rewarding good modeling solutions and penalizing less correct ones, with a dedicated feedback mechanism that maps correctly modeled elements to the corresponding concept. A preliminary laboratory experiment has been conducted with students of an Information Systems course to evaluate how students receive the mechanics and if there may be benefits in using a gamified environment for teaching process modeling throughout an entire course.  © 2023 ACM.",BPMN Modeling; Computer Engineering; Education; Gamification; Process Modeling,Curricula; Education computing; Engineering education; Learning systems; Process engineering; Software engineering; Teaching; Business process modeling; Business process modeling notation modeling; Computer engineering; Computer engineers; Experience report; Gamification; Good modelling practices; Modeling notation; Process-models; Teaching process; Students,,,,,,,"Anderson L.W., Krathwohl D.R., Airasian P.W., Cruikshank K.A., Mayer R.E., Pintrich P.R., Raths J., Wittrock M.C., A Taxonomy for Teaching, Learning, and Assessment, (2001); Bloom B.S., Engelhart M.D., Furst E.J., Hill W.H., Krathwohl D.R., Taxonomy of Educational Objectives: The Classification of Educational Goals.

It is an alternative educational focus that promotes students’ motivation and participation in the learning process. Gamification had proven effective in training health professionals and can play an important role in diagnostic radiology training, both at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels. Gamification activities can be carried out in real environments, such as classrooms or session rooms, but there are also interesting online modalities that favor remote access and user management. The possibilities of gamification in virtual worlds to teach undergraduate students radiology are very promising and deserve to be explored in training residents. This article aims to review general concepts in gamification and to present the main types of gamification used in medical training, pointing out its applications and advantages and disadvantages and emphasizing experiences in radiology education. © 2022 SERAM",Games; Gamification; Medical education; Medical students; Radiology; Residents,adult; article; education; female; gamification; human; human experiment; learning; male; medical education; medical student; motivation; postgraduate student; radiodiagnosis; resident; undergraduate student,,,,,,,"Whitebread D., Neale D., Jensen H., Liu C., Solis S.L., Hopkins E., Et al., The role of play in children's development: Aa review of the evidence White paper, The Lego Foundation, (2017); Landers, Auer R.N., Helms E.M., MarinS A.B., Armstrong M.B., Gamification of adult learning: Gamifying employee training and development, The Cambridge Handbook of Technology and Employee Behavior (Cambridge Handbooks in Psychology)., pp. 271-295, (2019); Pelling N., The (short) prehistory of gamification.

Diabetes education programs have been shown to be effective in improving health outcomes and diabetes self-management skills. Mobile health apps have emerged as useful tools for diabetes education; however, their use and acceptance by the target population remain inconsistent. Therefore, end-user participation in the design and development of a mobile health app is crucial for designing an acceptable app that can improve outcomes for populations with a chronic disease. Objective: The objective of this study was to apply an end-user participatory approach to co-design a diabetes education app prototype for people living with T2D by exploring their perceptions, acceptance, and usability of an app prototype, as well as their diabetes experience and perspectives on digital diabetes education. Methods: A total of 8 people with T2D, who were recruited from diabetes management Facebook groups, participated in 4 web-based surveys via Qualtrics and 2 structured interviews via Zoom (Zoom Video Communications, Inc) between August 20, 2021, and January 28, 2022. Descriptive statistics and thematic analyses of the discussion and iterative feedback on the app prototype were used to assess the participants’ perceptions of living with T2D, attitudes toward digital diabetes education, and acceptance of the prototype. Results: Analyses of the surveys and interview data revealed 3 themes: challenges of living with T2D; validation, acceptability, and usability of the diabetes education app prototype; and perspectives on digital diabetes education. In the first theme, participants highlighted the importance of solitary accountability, translating knowledge into practice, and developing pragmatic self-consciousness. The second theme indicated that the diabetes education app prototype was acceptable, with information and appearance being key; revealed ambivalent and polarized opinions toward the chatbot; and confirmed potential impact of the app on diabetes self-management skills and practice. The third theme comprised the necessity of using a variety of information-seeking strategies and recommendations for desired content and app qualities, including accessibility, adaptability, autonomy, evidence-based design and content, gamification, guidance, integration, personalization, and up-to-date content. The findings were used to reiterate the app design. Conclusions: Despite a small sample size, the study demonstrated the feasibility of engaging and empowering people living with T2D to consider digital therapeutics for diabetes self-management skills and practice. Participants gave rather positive feedback on the design and content of the app prototype, with some recommendations for improvements. The findings suggest that incorporating end-user feedback into app design can lead to the creation of feasible and acceptable tools for diabetes education, potentially improving outcomes for populations with a chronic disease. Further research is needed to test the impact of the refined diabetes education app prototype on diabetes self-management skills and practice and quality of life. ©Anita Pienkowska, Chin-Siang Ang, Maleyka Mammadova, Muhammad Daniel Azlan Mahadzir, Josip Car.",chatbot; chronic disease; co-design; diabetes; digital education; health apps; mHealth; mobile health; mobile phone; self-management; type 2 diabetes,,,,,,"Iva Bojic and Ivica Boticki; Ministry of Health, MOH, (MOH/NIC/CDM2/2018); National Medical Research Council, NMRC, (HSRG-DB17Nov002); Ministry of Health -Singapore, MOH","Funding text 1: This research is supported by the Singapore Ministry of Health’s National Medical Research Council under Health Services Research Grant (HSRG-DB17Nov002), and the Ministry of Health [grant number MOH/NIC/CDM2/2018].

This strategy is made up of the flipped classroom and gamification. Both methodological experiences allow a greater participation of the students in the dynamics of the class. This systematic review presents in an exploratory way the use os flipped learning (FL) together with gamification in the university stage. For this, a total of 58 articles have been reviewed contributions indexed in Scopues, ERIC and WoS until 2021. The results show that the publications mostly focus on knowing the motivational aspecto and participation after implementing the gamified flipped classroom pedagogicl strategy in the university stage. We can therefore deduce the importance of combining the positive aspects related to motivation academic performance and autonomy. © 2022 Authors.

The research serves as tangible evidence of enhanced language skills following the introduction of gamification, thereby underscoring the effectiveness of game-based learning activities in a higher education context. The investigation reveals that gamification techniques not only amplify student participation but also create meaningful and relevant contexts for language application, an aspect particularly advantageous for economics students who are often more attuned to numeric and analytic thinking. Despite the promising implications of gamification, the research does not shy away from the challenges that accompany its application. It carefully scrutinizes issues such as the considerable time and effort required for preparation, the need to strike a balance between the educational and playful aspects of gamification, maintaining fairness in competition, and the diverse impacts on students with varying learning styles and proficiencies. This study contributes to the evolving discourse on gamification in education. It opens up new avenues for future studies to further examine the long-term impacts of gamification, to understand the equilibrium between competition and cooperation in a gamified learning environment, and to explore the differential effects of gamification on learners with different characteristics. Overall, this study propels the conversation on gamification in education forward, paving the way for more effective and inclusive teaching strategies. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Case Study; Economics Education; Language Proficiency; Professional Foreign Language Competence; Second Language; Student Engagement; Student Motivation,Computer aided instruction; Economic analysis; Students; Case-studies; Deep dives; Economic education; Foreign language; Gamification; Language proficiency; Professional foreign language competence; Second language; Student engagement; Student motivation; Motivation,,,,,,,"Zubkov A., Teaching foreign language in transport university using massive open online courses: Pilot study, International Scientific Siberian Transport Forum Transsiberia-2021.

Social networks are informal platforms where students can develop their own skills in order to adapt to the digital environment and where there is visibility in public rankings. Consequently, we argue that digital social capital developed through the use of social networks can promote student motivation and engagement in online gamification practices, which in turn might help to enhance their course performance. Our empirical study applies a survey-based approach on a sample of 133 undergraduate students enrolled in a hybrid course in corporate finance at a Spanish public university during the COVID-19 pandemic. Empirical evidence suggests that stronger digital social capital (i.e. a greater number of following contacts in social networks) increases a student's propensity to participate in Kahoot! gamification. Additionally, digital social capital has a positive indirect effect on a student's academic performance, with this relationship being mediated by Kahoot! participation. This educational research encourages links between different digital technologies to be exploited to a greater extent in order to strengthen student engagement and maximize their academic performance. © 2023",Academic performance; Gamification; Higher education; Learning technologies; Social networks,,,,,,"Castilla y León, (2022)","The authors appreciate the useful comments received from Neil Marriott (the Editor-in-Chief), two anonymous reviewers, and participants at the International Congress on Innovative Education in Business and Economics ICIEBE (2021), the International Workshop on Gamification and Motivational Technologies GAMOTEC (2021), and the 1st Workshop on Innovative Teaching of Public Universities from Castilla y León (2022).

Utilizing the trading data of investors who simultaneously have active portfolios in an investment firm and stock market simulation game, we show that investors have different biases in real versus simulated settings. We find that participating in a stock market game affects all biases differently, with different degrees of participation to the game. While overconfidence bias and disposition effect can be mitigated and decrease with more active participation in the game, familiarity and status quo biases increase. We also show that young, inexperienced investors with average-sized portfolios and men are more likely to participate. These findings will especially be of interest to researchers, financial institutions and governmental bodies that plan to conduct similar experiments and design services promoting better financial decision-making and investment behavior. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Behavioral finance; Experimental design; Financial education; Fintech; Gamification; Overconfidence; Stock market game,,,,,,,,"Almenberg J., Dreber A., Gender, stock market participation and financial literacy, Econ.

The author studied the user intention toward a traditional mindset of non-sharing rides to sharing rides. This research paper collected direct observations, reflecting gamified aspects as the indicator to encourage individual intent to participate. The research approach of this study is exploratory, where primary participants were corporate working professionals of different organizations. The hypotheses in this study support the research objective where gamification acted as a critical driver for positively influencing user engagement toward ridesharing platform applications. Gamification has quickly adapted to education, marketing, and healthcare industries to affect user involvement and attitude. The study enumerates the existing literature, where several attempted to eliminate carbon footprints toward sustainable development. The gamification in the online rideshare platform attempts to strengthen the number of rideshares. This research computes the ridesharing approach through the mobile application to leverage the benefit and catch up with the new commute technique toward sustainable development. The study opens a new method to contribute and participate in the gamified ride. It positively impacts the user attitude and participation toward sustainable development goals (SDG), as the current literature limits the study in the Indian context. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Carbon footprint; Carpool; Climate change; Gamification; Gamify; Leaderboard; Rewards; Rideshare; Sustainability; Sustainable cities and communities; Sustainable development goal 11; Sustainable development goal 13; Sustainable transport,Climate change; Emission control; Sustainable development; Carpool; Gamification; Gamify; Leaderboard; Reward; Rideshare; Sustainable cities; Sustainable communities; Sustainable development goal 11; Sustainable development goal 13; Sustainable transport; Carbon footprint,,,,,,,"Jiao Z., Sharma R., Kautish P., Hussain H.I., Unveiling the asymmetric impact of exports, oil prices, technological innovations, and income inequality on carbon emissions in India, Resour Policy, 74, (2021); Olsson L.E., Sinha R., Frostell B., Friman M., What can be done to change?—The environmental and behavioral consequences of interventions for sustainable travel, Sustain, 14, 3, (2022); Hamari J., Hassan L., Dias A., Gamification, quantified-self, or social networking?

However, little is known about the factors that help or hinder their implementation. This qualitative study aimed to address this gap in the literature by systematically investigating the facilitators (organizational and experiential) and barriers to successful implementation of a community-wide intervention delivered in Gloucester, the United Kingdom. A two-phased process evaluation was conducted. Phase 1 involved the thematical analysis of open question feedback from n = 289 adults. Phase 2 included three focus groups conducted with n = 12 participants. This research showed that promoting the initiative through primary education settings was fundamental to enhancing awareness and participation. Social elements of the intervention were identified as a motivating factor for, and a consequential outcome of, participation. A lack of promotion to wider-reaching proportions of the community was perceived to be a significant barrier to implementation, potentially limiting inclusivity and participation in the activity.

The research develops standardized methodologies and algorithms to evaluate trainees' performance across platforms, creating a unified scoring system reflecting educational progress. Diverse gamification techniques are implemented to attract and engage trainees, promoting active participation and continuous improvement. Existing gamification methodologies are analyzed and tailored to specific user profiles, enhancing motivation and learning outcomes. Moreover, the research explores the potential of an AI-Assisted co-pilot system that generates personalized exercises based on trainees' skills, guiding them towards areas requiring improvement. The anticipated outcomes include a standardized evaluation system, enriched learning experiences, personalized training approaches, and an AI-driven co-pilot system. This work advances cybersecurity education, fostering a more effective and engaging learning environment. The motivation for this research arises from the need to enhance learner engagement and improve cyber security education. © 2023 Owner/Author.",Cyber Security; Education; Gamification,Computer aided instruction; Learning systems; Motivation; User profile; Cyber security; Cyber security trainings; Cyber-security educations; Education and training; Gamification; Performance; PhD thesis; Pilot system; Power; Scoring systems; Cybersecurity,,,,,,,"European Defence Agency, (2018); Andreolini M., Giuseppe Colacino V., Colajanni M., Marchetti M., 2020 A Framework for the Evaluation of Trainee Performance in Cyber Range Exercises, Mobile Networks and Applications, 25, pp. 236-247, (2020); Brilingaite A., Bukauskas L., Juozapavicius A., 2020 A framework for competence development and assessment in hybrid cybersecurity exercises, Computers & Security, 88, (2020); Buljan M., Gamification for Learning: Strategies and Examples, (2021); Circadence, (2020); Le Compte A., Elizondo D.A., Watson T., 2015 A renewed approach to serious games for cyber security, 2015 7th International Conference on Cyber Conflict: Architectures in Cyberspace, pp. 203-216, (2015); Cyber-MAR, (2020); De Sousa Borges S., Durelli S.V.H., Macedo Reis H., Isotani S., 2014.

This paper supports these findings and adds the factor of online teaching analyzing the results of an experiment carried out in an online higher education context to test the relevance and motivational efficacy of ludic methodologies using learning and knowledge technology. Three groups of students (n=78, n=64, and n=74) participated in gamified experiences in the same subject. These groups were offered different approaches to the experiences, only one of which included a reward. Neither of the gamified experiences was compulsory. The results show how the use of technologies and gamification is not as appealing as it may seem and how other aspects—such as teacher-student relationship and interaction, rewards, and the sense of alienation generated by online teaching—influence student participation. The low rate of participation indicates that teachers must consider not only those students who participate but also those who do not. The main conclusion is that not only the methodology is important, but also the performance and the fact that student-teacher relationship in online education is more demanding, affectively speaking. Thus, those students who were in direct contact with the teacher during the execution of the gamified experience present a higher level of involvement. This is a factor to consider for the motivational needs of online university students where intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and direct interaction play essential roles. © 2022 by authors.",alienation; e-learning; gamification; higher education; interaction; motivation,,,,,,"GAME-EDU, (PIE19-186); GAMITEST, (B0041); Universidad de Málaga, UMA; Universidad Internacional de La Rioja, UNIR; Federación Española de Enfermedades Raras, FEDER, (2020-2023, PID2019-105678RB-C21)","Author contributions: MTC: conceptualization, methodology, validation, formal analysis, investigation, resources, visualization, writing-original draft, and supervision; JMDL: validation, resources, writing–original draft, and writing– reviewing and editing.

It explains concepts such as gamification and Digital Game-Based Learning; it focuses on the typology of games and the positives and negatives of playing digital games while discussing the aspects of their implementation in education. The case study presented in the paper examines in more detail digital games as a supplement to the learning environment in technically oriented education at the primary level of elementary schools in Slovakia (ISCED 1). The main focus is on an analysis of digital and education aspects of selected digital games. Specifically, based on nine game assessment criteria, such as game content in line with the objectives, application of cross-cutting themes, motivation, way of manipulation, active participation of the pupil, design/graphic processing, playing time, game model and its objective. Each of these criteria can influence the application of selected games in teaching; therefore, we assessed the games individually through these criteria. © 2023 by the authors of this article.

With the success of gamification in other medical education applications, we sought to investigate if a novel gamified curricular innovation would lead to improved test performance and confidence in the ability to manage a real mass casualty incident (MCI). Methods: This was a prospective observational study of medical students and emergency medicine residents who participated in a 4-h simulation-based competition consisting of 4 unique stations. Each station had learning objectives associated with the content taught. Learners completed a pre-event survey, followed by participation in the competitive gamification event, and subsequently completed a post-event survey. Differences between pre- and post-event responses were matched and analyzed using paired and unpaired t tests for medical knowledge assessments, the Mann–Whitney U test for perceptions of confidence in the ability to manage an MCI event, and descriptive statistics provided on perceptions of the effectiveness of this educational strategy. Results: We analyzed data from 49 learners with matched (and unmatched) pre- and post-event survey responses. There was a statistically significant increase in medical knowledge assessment scores in both unmatched group means and available matched data (47 to 69%, p < 0.01, and 50 to 69%, p < 0.05). Self-reported confidence in the ability to handle an MCI scenario also significantly increased (p < 0.01). Finally, 100% of respondents indicated they “agreed” or “strongly agreed” that the event was an effective education tool for disaster preparedness and training. Conclusions: In this study, we found that learners perceived a novel gamification event as an effective educational tool, which led to improved learner knowledge and self-reported confidence in the ability to manage a real MCI. © 2023, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Disaster medicine; Gamification; Mass casualty incident; Medical education; Simulation,adult; article; competition; controlled study; disaster; disaster medicine; disaster preparedness; education; emergency medicine; female; gamification; human; human experiment; learning; male; mass disaster; medical education; medical student; observational study; perception; prospective study; rank sum test; resident; simulation; task performance,,,,,,,"Denolf R.L., Kahwaji C.I., (2022); Schenk E., Wijetunge G., Mann N.C., Lerner E.B., Longthorne A., Dawson D., Epidemiology of mass casualty incidents in the United States, Prehosp Emerg Care, 18, 3, pp. 408-416, (2014); Binkley J.M., Kemp K.M., Mobilization of resources and emergency response on the national scale, Surg Clin North Am, 102, 1, pp. 169-180, (2022); Mohanty C.R., Radhakrishnan R.V., Stephen S., Epidemiology of mass casualty incidents in a tertiary care trauma center in eastern India: A retrospective observational study, Turk J Emerg Med, 22, 2, pp. 96-103, (2022); Mass Casualty Management Systems: Strategies and Guidelines for Building Health Sector Capacity, (2007); 2022 Disasters in Numbers, (2023); McElroy J.A., Steinberg S., Keller J., Falcone R.E., Operation continued care: a large mass-casualty, full-scale exercise as a test of regional preparedness, Surgery, 166, 4, pp. 587-592, (2019); Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program; Kaji A.H., Waeckerle J.F., Disaster medicine and the emergency medicine resident, Ann Emerg Med, 41, 6, pp. 865-870, (2003); Vargas J.P., Hubloue I., Pinzon J.J., Duque A.C., The effect of training and experience on mass casualty incident triage performance: evidence from emergency personnel in a high complexity university hospital, Am J Disaster Med, 14, 2, pp. 113-119, (2019); Moran M.E., Zimmerman J.R., Chapman A.D., Ballas D.A., Blecker N., George R.L., Staff perspectives of mass casualty incident preparedness, Cureus, 13, 6, (2021); Moran M.E., Ballas D., Blecker N., Et al., Evolution of a mass casualty drill design team: a program evaluation, J Emerg Manag, 19, 4, pp. 367-377, (2021); Bentley S., Iavicoli L., Boehm L., A simulated mass casualty incident triage exercise: SimWars, Mededportal, 15, (2019); Ledbury K., Glasgow S., Tallach R., Learning from simulating mass casualty events: A systematic search and a comprehensive qualitative review, Disaster Med Public Health Prep, 17, (2022); Sarin R.R., Cattamanchi S., Alqahtani A., Aljohani M., Keim M., Ciottone G.R., Disaster education: a survey study to analyze disaster medicine training in emergency medicine residency programs in the United States, Prehosp Disaster Med, 32, 4, pp. 368-373, (2017); Shrestha R., Kanchan T., Krishan K., Simulation training and skill assessment in disaster medicine, Statpearls, (2022); Tovar M.A., Zebley J.A., Higgins M., Et al., Exposure to a virtual reality mass-casualty simulation elicits a differential sympathetic response in medical trainees and attending physicians [, Prehosp Disaster Med, 38, 1, pp. 1-9, (2023); Liu J., Huang Y., Li B., Gui L., Zhou L., Development and evaluation of innovative and practical table-top exercises based on a real mass-casualty incident, Disaster Med Public Health Prep, 17, (2022); Deterding S., Dixon D., Khaled R., Nacke L., From game design elements to gamefulness, Proceedings of the 15Th International Academic Mindtrek Conference on Envisioning Future Media Environments.

One of the most innovative gamification techniques emerging in the current educational context is the escape room, whose implementation aims to promote student motivation and learning. A review of the literature shows that many of the previous works lack a solid theoretical basis when it comes to explaining the motivational effects associated with student participation in this experience. Therefore, the aim of this study is to analyze the relationship between gamification and motivation and identify which dimensions of gamification experience—through an educational escape room—better predict students’ motivation, based on the framework of self-determination theory. (2) Methods. This research develops a quantitative and correlational methodology. A total of 135 first-year university students participated. (3) Results. The results of the regression models showed that creative thinking, activation, and dominance predicted intrinsic motivation toward knowledge, achievement, and stimulating experiences. Likewise, a higher level of negative affect was predictive of amotivation and external regulation motivation in students. (4) Conclusions. These findings provide new empirical evidence that could guide the design of educational experiences through escape rooms in the context of higher education. © 2023 by the authors.",educational escape room; gamification; higher education; learning; motivation,education; higher education; learning; self determination; student; university sector,,,,,,,"Usan P., Salavera C., Motivación escolar, inteligencia emocional y rendimiento académico en estudiantes de educación secundaria obligatoria, Actual.

The transition from classroom activities to digital learning such as quizzes, debates, brainstorming and more tools, have open many opportunities for researchers to analyze, design or develop the application. This research is to regard the gamification in learning which was used by researcher since 2010 in the classroom activities. A literature review was done on the gamification in a learning process before and after the epidemic and how it gives impact on student's affective elements in learning. Besides the literature review, we conducted a preliminary inquiry after students have had experienced the gamification in their learning before the epidemic. We conducted two forms of methods: a focus group conducted prior to the pandemic and an internet survey conducted after the outbreak. Aside from the investigation, we were able to determine students' motivation in online classes by pulling real data from their class access time in the morning class via Blackboard Learn online platform. Aligning traditional teaching and activities in the classroom requires work and ingenuity in terms of how to design it on an online platform while maintaining the same level of participation. We are currently transformed our usual classroom activity such as SUDOKU quiz game into a mobile educational game prototype. Due to the short duration of our project grant, the game prototype will be developed using prototype method. Some planned gaming aspects are suggested in the game, which will be discussed later. © 2023 American Institute of Physics Inc..

Millennials are used to living with gadgets from an early age. So, it is difficult to separate them from the gadget. Low and passive student participation in class is also a problem at the moment. Lecturers need innovation in the teaching learning process. Online gamification is one of the solutions to overcome this problem. Making online games in the teaching learning process to invite students to learn using their gadgets. It's just that the problem now is whether the lecturer himself is familiar with online gamification or not. The challenge is how to increase awareness and intention to use online gamification by lecturers. We made this research using quantitative research methods. We collect data by distributing questionnaires to our respondents, namely lecturers who teach in higher education. Data analysis used path analysis structural equation modeling using Smart PLS 4 software. The results of our study found that perceived usefulness had no significant effect on lecturers' intention to adopt online gamification, but if it was moderated with organizational support, it had a significant effect. Perceived ease of use has a significant effect on perceived usefulness and lecturers' intention to adopt online gamification. Organization support is able to moderate effect of perceived ease of use to lecturer' intention to adopt online gamification. Lecturer' intention has a significant effect on actual usage of online gamification.  © 2023 ACM.",64TOnline; Gamification; Intention; Learning; Teaching,E-learning; Education computing; Learning systems; Regression analysis; Teaching; 64tonline; Gamification; High educations; Intention; Learning; Perceived ease-of-use; Perceived usefulness; Teaching activities; Teaching-learning; Teaching-learning process; Students,,,,,,,"Roehling P.V., Vander Kooi T.L., Dykema S., Quisenberry B., Vandlen C., Engaging the Millennial Generation in Class Discussions, Coll.

This article explores the potential for collaboration, education, and creation of live-streaming platforms by analyzing the online coworking experience of the JaimeAltozano 'working room' on Twitch, launched after the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. An initiative that gathered 222,172 hours worked by the community in three months. Using a mixed methods research design, the experience was studied on the basis of quantitative data, 67 in-depth interviews with users and ethnographic techniques for content analysis. The results obtained in the three phases of the research process show that experiences like the JaimeAltozano 'working room' are useful virtual spaces for productivity. Based on these results, a map of the phenomenon was drawn using six key concepts: gamification, synchronicity, community, participation, free operability, and common atmosphere. In the face of the growing platformization of cultural goods, our research delves into the media reality of Twitch beyond videogaming to explore the possibilities of live-streaming for the digital community's media empowerment. © 2022 University of Piura.

This makes it difficult for educators to teach or train their students, co-workers, or users. The audience of this paper is both educators and learners who struggle with modeling. To address this challenge, we present PapyGame, a gamified version of a robust modeling environment (Papyrus) that aims to improve the learner's motivation, make the learning process an enjoyable experience, and boost learning outcomes. Gamification is the exploitation of gaming mechanisms for serious purposes, such as promoting behavioral changes, soliciting participation and engagement in activities, and more. The paper presents PapyGame's functionalities, architectures, illustrative scenarios, and its potential impact on both educators and learners. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",Education; Gamification; Model-based engineering; Papyrus; Training,Education computing; Engineering environment; Gamification; Learner's motivations; Learning outcome; Learning process; Model-based engineering; Modeling environments; Papyrus; Robust modeling; Workers'; Learning systems,,,,,,,"Koivisto J., Hamari J., The rise of motivational information systems: a review of gamification research, Int.

This experience has been carried out under a triple new scenario: the virtuality due to the Covid-19 pandemic, added to the gamified training, and the assessment carried out remotely. Both the content and the assessment of the subject have been presented using three gamification web tools (Kahoot!, Mentimeter, and Socrative) and three learning complexity (Lexicon, Comprehension, and Visual & Relationship). The content of the subject has been taught in a dynamic, entertaining, and active way. An important factor that has been taken into account was student diversity when responding to gamified elements, using different gamification tools and different learning complexity. This experience of gamification had a positive impact on student motivation, class attendance, participation, collaborative learning, and classroom climate, which is key in a scenario like the current one, with an adaptation of classes to online learning due to the pandemic. From the results obtained, it can be stated that the gamified experience, even offering a good result compared to previous academic years, did not provide a significant improvement in the overall academic performance of the students. Regarding the gamification tools, the one that presented a slight advantage over the rest was Socrative, which is based on a particular challenge without competition between peers or groups. Regarding the learning complexity, all presented a similar level of success. © 2021 The Authors.

These recent events have proved the necessity for engineers to adapt by acquiring new technical skills. To facilitate the shift to digital technologies, as well as to enhance students’ engagement, this study investigates the introduction of Python as a tool to solve chemical engineering problems, aiming to improve students’ learning experience by providing stimulating material and gamification. The Python material, covering topics such as stoichiometry, design of chemical reactors, and mass and energy balances, was embedded into the curriculum of a BEng. Course in Chemical Reaction Engineering at the Technical University of Denmark. Preliminary results seem to confirm that digital tools generate higher engagement and participation among students, leading to better understanding and higher performance. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",digital education; programming in engineering curriculum; Python,,,,,,,,"de Las Heras S.C., Gargalo C.L., Gernaey K.V., Kruhne U., Programming skills across the (bio) engineering curriculum–a students’ perspective, Computer Aided Chemical Engineering, 50, pp. 2039-2044, (2021); dos Santos M.T., Vianna A.S., Le Roux G.A., Programming skills in the industry 4.0: are chemical engineering students able to face new problems?, Education for Chemical Engineers, 22, pp. 69-76, (2018); Gargalo C.L., Heras S.C.D.L., Jones M.N., Udugama I., Mansouri S.S., Kruhne U., Gernaey K.V., Towards the development of digital twins for the bio-manufacturing industry, Digital Twins, pp. 1-34, (2020); Narayanan H., Luna M.F., von Stosch M., Cruz Bournazou M.N., Polotti G., Morbidelli M., Butte A., Sokolov M., Bioprocessing in the digital age: the role of process models, Biotechnology journal, 15, 1, (2020); PyCRE 2022, Python for Chemical Reaction Engineering (PyCRE), (2022)",,,Elsevier B.V.,,,,,,15707946,,,,English,Comput.

It is crucial to engage first-year students from the first moment of university entrance, to support their transition from secondary to higher education, and to facilitate their learning experiences and learning outcomes. This study starts from the dual premise that orientation activities offer first-year students important transitional support to cope with the stressful challenges while enabling a sense of community, and that, as students sometimes consider orientation activities as tedious, gamification might make participation more enjoyable, while stimulating students' motivation and information retention. Based on educational literature on gamification of learning settings, this study presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a gamified orientation day, organised for first-year students. The design of the gamified orientation day is based on the eight gamification features of Apostol, Zaharescu and Alexe (2013): players, story, goals, rules, problem solving, feedback, safe environment, and sense of mastery. The objectives of the orientation day and its practical implementation are explained on the theoretical basis of these eight features. Qualitative survey data (N=1326) were collected to evaluate the strengths of the orientation day and the areas for further improvement. The data show that students perceive the gamified orientation day as a pleasant learning experience. Students appreciate collaborating with peer students and their active participation in knowledge acquisition. This study provides evidence-based best practices for the gamification of orientation days, and aims to inspire other universities in adapting their strategy on facilitating the transition and orientation of first-year students. © 2022 Dechema e.V..

The focus of the paper is the technological approach built from the results of research using lifeworld analysis to identify the barriers and drivers to youth participation. This technological approach combines on the one hand, the KEY Tool, a simplified goal-oriented social network to share and interact with local and international peers; on the other hand, the KEY game, a false instant-messaging application based on a voodoo story, where the user has a key role. Several pilot groups worked under the programme implemented in the Keystone project, including working with those digital tools. Results show important benefits for participating young people in areas such as respect, digital literacy and multi-cultural abilities, and highlight several opportunities to take further advantage of these tools. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Gamification in education; Keystone Project; Risk of social exclusion; Technological social interaction,Gamification; Gamification in education; Keystone project; Multi-disciplinary approach; Risk of social exclusion; Social exclusion; Social interactions; Technological social interaction; Young peoples; Youths at risks; Digital devices,,,,,"Research Institute for Innovation and Technology in Education; European Commission, EC","This work is partially supported by the project Keystone (contract number: 2017-2-UK01-KA205-037106 ) funded by the European Commission under the Erasmus +Programme, and the Research Institute for Innovation and Technology in Education at the Universidad Internacional de La Rioja (UNIR).

Design/methodology/approach: This study took 147 university libraries in China as research object, analyzed the gamification services announced by these libraries on official websites, Weibo, WeChat and other platforms during the period from July 1, 2021 to August 20, 2022, and investigated the gamification services from the four aspects of functions, forms, game elements and mechanisms. Findings: The results show that the gamification service of university library in China is often used in the popularization of scientific and cultural knowledge, information literacy education, reading promotion, library service promotion and library entrance education. Questions and answers, points contests, passing the game level and treasure hunting are common forms of games. At the same time, many gamification services combine game elements such as points, leaderboards and grades with the game mechanism to enhance readers’ participation. Originality/value: This study investigates gamification services of university libraries in China and provides suggestions for optimizing gamification services, which can provide reference for libraries in China and other countries. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Game design;

The study was designed to achieve three goals. The first goal was to find out the growing role of the phenomenon of “social responsibility” in the changing situation of the ongoing industrial and digital revolution and its impact on humanity as a whole and on everyday life of everyone. The second goal was to find out the respondents’ opinions and interpretations of the phenomenon of “social responsibility’ and to compare the answers of Russian and American students to analyze whether there is any difference in understanding this social issue and whether they are ready to except this responsibility on the personal level. The data were obtained from the students’ answers to the questionnaire. In general, the study revealed a not very high level of understanding of the investigated phenomenon, but we observed some inconsistency in its understanding by Russian and American students, especially in personal responsibility. And the third goal was to develop some new approaches and forms that appear in the modern educational ecosystem, integrating humanities and technical components of higher education, considering gamification as one of the innovative tools to stimulate students’ active participation and transform their perception and practice of social responsibility. The new concept of future engineers’ social responsibility formation in the context of a humanitarian educational ecosystem opens additional opportunities in practical and theoretical areas of modern education, has a high social significance, since it allows conceptually and practically solving the issue of developing unified approaches to the implementation of social responsibility formation tasks, which is extremely important both for existing and for future generations. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",educational ecosystem; gamification; higher professional education; integration of Humanities and Technical education; social responsibility; training of future engineers,Engineering education; Engineers; Personnel training; Social aspects; Students; Educational ecosystem; Educational program; First year students; Gamification; High professional education; Integration of humanity and technical education; Professional education; Social responsibilities; Technical educations; Training of future engineer; Ecosystems,,,,,,,"Canney N.E., Bielefeldt A.R., A framework for the development of social responsibility in engineers, Int.

One of the proposals has been to reuse Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs) as Small Online Private Courses (SPOCs), or as complementary resources in traditional courses through blended learning practices, such as flipped classroom. However, the integration of online courses as a complement to face-to-face courses poses some challenges. First, students are not used to such blended learning approaches and it is generally difficult for teachers to motivate them to access online resources for the preparation of face-to-face sessions. Second, students are not used to the dynamics of blended learning scenarios, which are less teacher-centered and require their active participation. We propose the use of the mobile application MyMOOCSpace (MMS) to meet these challenges and increase students’ motivation and use of learning resources in blended learning courses that use SPOCs as a complement. MMS is a mobile learning application based on gamification mechanisms to promote collaboration and motivation of students in the use of digital resources as a complement to blended learning courses. In this paper, we present the results of a quasi-experiment in a blended course with 294 students that uses a SPOC as a complement, with the aim to assess the effect of MMS on students’ motivation and learning resources consumption. In particular, the behavior of two groups of students with the main digital resources of the SPOC (videos and formative assessments) was analyzed: one using the MMS (GTest group), and the other not using MMS (GTrad group). The results suggest that the use of MMS had a positive correlation with the videos consumption, besides increasing student’ interaction with assessment exercises in the SPOC. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",blended course; collaboration; gamification; mobile learning; SPOC,,,,,,"LALA, (586120-EPP-1-2017-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP); Madrid Regional Government; Universidad Bernardo O'Higgins; Universidad Bernardo O’Higgins, (1000/532/14, 14ENI2-26862); Ministerio de Ciencia, Innovación y Universidades, MCIU; European Commission, EC; Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica, CONICYT, (21161264, P2018/TCS-4307); European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, (TIN2017-85179-C3-1-R); Agencia Estatal de Investigación, AEI","This work was supported by PROF-XXI: [Grant Number 609767-EPP-1-2019-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP]; InnovaT: [Grant Number 598758-EPP-1-2018-1-AT-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP]; Conicyt: [Grant Number 21161264]; eMadrid Network: [Grant Number P2018/TCS-4307]; FEDER–Project Smartlet: [Grant Number TIN2017-85179-C3-1-R]; LALA Project: [Grant Number 586120-EPP-1-2017-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP]; Universidad Bernardo O’Higgins, Santiago’s grant: [Grant Number UBO ‘H Rect.

Tutorial sessions are often ineffective as a result of poor attendance and engagement, with these effects exacerbated by large class sizes, non-homogenous student groups, and the pressures of hybrid and remote learning. Gamification of some aspects of formative assessments and tutorials using mobile and app-based quizzes has proved to be successful in improving lecture theatre dynamics, reducing distractions and enhancing student attendance and engagement. Such gamified sessions can be perceived as engaging, competitive, visually appealing, and entertaining, while providing instant feedback and empowering students to navigate their own learning. Careful gamification of problem classes for engineering topics can enable more effective self-regulation of learning through a combination of effort regulation and metacognition. This paper presents both lowand high-threshold gamification strategies adopted in a U.K. higher education setting to enhance student learning in a set of challenging undergraduate engineering courses ranging from less than 30 students to more than 180 students, and qualitatively assesses impact and student reactions. While there is much literature canvassing student opinions on gamification, extensive individual student voice tends to be missing. Therefore, one of our authors, who is a recent graduate, presents a detailed reflection on her experiences of gamification. Finally, we present some conclusions for further exploration and adoption by practitioners, considering the most effective ways to deploy the various types of gamification. These conclusions include recommendations to use app-based quiz games with anonymous participation both within and outside the classroom, gamifying either single sessions or the course as a whole, and the need to continue supplementing quiz-game learning with more traditional problems and worked solutions. © 2023 by the authors.",engagement; engineering education; Gamification; interactive; metacognition,,,,,,"University of Liverpool, UoL","The authors would like to thank the University of Liverpool for support from the Faculty of Science and Engineering Faculty Enhancement Fund, which has indirectly influenced this work.","UK games industry market valuation 2020, (2021); Casey J.

A mixed methodology is used where the qualitative analysis traces the roadmap for the quantitative one, identifying the key themes revealed by a sample of 11 students, which were then used to build a survey launched to 106 students. The conclusions are, firstly, Quizizz can maintain the curiosity and attention of the students, improve participation and motivation in the virtual classroom, and generate pleasant learning experiences; second, students perceived Quizizz as an engaging and fun platform; third, competitiveness emerged as an important variable driving students’ intrinsic motivation, driven by the desire to be among the top ranks in game rankings; and fourth, Quizizz is a valuable tool for reviewing and retaining key concepts and ideas, but not necessarily for improving test scores. Finally, Quizizz has a positive influence over motivation, engagement, and dynamization of the virtual classroom. © 2022 IGI Global.

This research aims to assess the effectiveness of the Foodball gamification program, applied to nutritional education as a strategy for innovation and learning and, specifically, its relationship with the teacher perception of organizational culture in education. A transversal methodology was used with students between 7 and 10 years old (n = 185), and teachers (n = 55) from 14 public primary schools in Rome and Ostia (Italy). Ad hoc assessment scales and the Organizational Culture Inventory (OCI) were used in the collection of information. For the analysis of the data, descriptive and inferential tests were carried out. The results associate the potential of these resources with an active participation and motivation in the learning process, as well as with the internalization of the information. Likewise, the teachers who participated in the educational entertainment crossmedia format obtained higher scores in the perception of the organizational culture, revealing significant differences according to gender and the acceptance of error as a unit value, and age with the perception of innovation. It is concluded in the need to deepen in these results through the design of longitudinal studies on the use of gamification resources and its effective incidence in the organizational culture. © The Author(s) 2023.",active learning; eating habits; educational technology; edutainment; Foodball; gamification; organizational culture,,,,,,"Group for Innovation, Inclusion and Research of the University of Burgos","This study was completed with the support of the Research Group Recognized in Intellectual Disability and Behavior (DISCONDU), and the Group for Innovation, Inclusion and Research of the University of Burgos.

At this point, the concept of gamification learning has become popular. Gamification applies game thinking and mechanics to non-game areas to guide user interaction and use. Based on Professor Kevin Werbach's gamification design framework, this study developed a case study of gamification for online teacher training, implemented in a professional development program for primary and secondary school teachers in Zhejiang Province, China. A self-administered questionnaire was then surveyed in three teaching classes, and the results found that: Firstly The participants' satisfaction in response to the gamification case was at a moderate to high level (M > 4.0, Tot = 5.0); Secondly, demographic factors did not significantly influence this (p > 0.05); Thirdly, among the gamification design influencing factors, presentation and feedback were the most influential (b = 0.536,p = 0.000), goals and rules (b = 0.167, p = 0.012), communication and interaction (b = 0.155, p = 0.029), and personalization (b = 0.154, p = 0.020) in decreasing order; Fourthly, The effect of case implementation significantly impacted participants' intention to sustain participation (b = 0.874, p = 0.000). Finally, we distilled the study's shortcomings and the prospects for future research. © 2023",Degree of satisfaction; Gamification; Gamification design; Teachers' online training,,,,,,"Zhejiang Institute of Higher Education, ""Research on the Competence of Zhejiang University, (KT2022044)","This work was supported by the key project of Zhejiang Institute of Higher Education, ""Research on the Competence of Zhejiang University Teachers in Digital Transformation [No. KT2022044 ].

The practice is expressed in the Essence graphic notation language. Through practice, a multimedia experience based on gamification, called Coco-Shapes, was developed to assist learning of the English language in the following topics: geometric figures, colors and counting. The study is aimed at children aged between 4 and 5 years of age, in the transition grade in a private school, and in a vulnerable community with scarce resources in the city of Cali (Colombia). A research process was conducted for this experience, with the participation of two groups of students: one experimental group and one control group. The results are optimistic, since it is evident that, through carrying out the activities that make up the practice, the solution achieved contributes to increased user learning, as well as favors a greater receptivity in the students towards the use of technology in the training process. © 2023 by the authors.",elementary education; gamification; Interactive Multimedia Experience (IME),Cali; Colombia; Valle del Cauca; design; learning; multimedia; primary education; research work; student,,,,,"Universidad Autónoma de Occidente, UAO",This research was funded by Universidad Autónoma de Occidente.,"Sakulwichitsintu S., Colbeck D., Ellis L., Turner P., A Peer Learning Framework for Enhancing Students’ Learning Experiences in Online Environment, Proceedings of the IEEE 18th International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies (ICALT); Pelaez C., Solano A., Granollers T., Proposal to Conceive Multimedia Systems from a Value Creation Perspective and a Collaborative Work Routes Approach, Interact.

Self-directed learning methodologies used along with simulators may represent a good alternative to traditional teaching methods. The aims of this study were to analyse veterinary students' degree of acceptance of self-directed learning using the PhysioEx simulator in physiology, and to evaluate self-directed learning outcomes using different approaches (individual vs. collaborative). Methods: The study was carried out over three academic years. Students conducted different activities on the PhysioEx simulator, either in an individual or cooperative mode. Once the activities were finished, students voluntarily participated in an opinion survey regarding self-directed learning methodology. Finally, an evaluation of learning outcomes was made through Kahoot!. Results: Students expressed a high degree of satisfaction with this self-directed learning method, with the combination of self-directed learning and gamification being scored the highest. Although students prefer the collaborative method, no differences in learning outcomes were found between the two learning approaches. Conclusion: The self-directed learning method in combination with gamification increased the motivation of students, who obtained suitable learning outcomes regardless of whether an individual or collaborative approach was followed. © 2022 The Authors.

An empirical study is carried out here on the use of gamification techniques in two engineering courses, in the field of Thermal Engineering, taught in two Spanish universities during several academic years. Both courses have similar syllabuses, and require the understanding and application of relatively complex concepts, related to Thermodynamics and Heat Transfer. The aim of this work was to increase students´ motivation and to help them in the process of assimilating and establishing key concepts related to these courses. Students´ satisfaction with the activity was assessed by means of surveys designed and proposed according to the Student Evaluation of Educational Quality (SEEQ) model, using a statistical package. The students were quite satisfied with the participation in the activity, the teamwork, the organization, and the grades. However, they considered that the learning of concepts was stronger in traditional classes. No significant differences were found between degrees or group size. Incorporating gamification techniques has proved to have a motivating effect on students, getting them involved in learning and in the development of the course. © 2023 The Authors",Engagement; Gamification; Higher education; Learning method; Motivation; Thermal engineering,Curricula; Education computing; Engineering education; Heat transfer; Learning systems; Students; Teaching; Thermal Engineering; Empirical studies; Engagement; Engineering course; Gamification; High educations; Learning methods; Learning process; Student motivation; Student satisfaction; Thermal engineering; Motivation,,,,,,,"Alhammad M.M., Moreno A.M., Gamification in software engineering education: a systematic mapping, J.

The concept of gamification offers a modern approach to the strategic design of courses, among others, concerning the optimal motivation of participants. Based on a case study of the international, interdisciplinary online course of the International Design and Engineering Education Association (IDEEA) and the subsequent evaluation with modern digital simulation tools, this research shows how gamification strategies can be sustainably integrated into digital courses to strengthen the motivation and participation of students. The results show a fundamental consistency between the case study and the newly developed simulation model and will therefore be transferred into a process for the general application of gamification in courses for teaching staff at universities. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Engineering design; Gamification; Motivation; Online course,Curricula; E-learning; Education computing; Engineering education; Students; Teaching; Case-studies; Digital simulation; Engineering design; Gamification; Interdisciplinary teams; International designs; International engineering; Online course; Strategic design; Student motivation; Motivation,,,,,,,"Deterding S., Dixon D., Khaled R., Nacke L., From game design elements to gamefulness: Defining gamification, Proceedings of the 15Th International Academic Mindtrek Conference: Envisioning Future Media Environments, pp. 9-15, (2011); Kessing D., Lower M., Work-in-progress: Gamification and design thinking–a motivational analysis of an international, interdisciplinary, team-based university course, ICBL 2020.

To increase the citizens’ awareness and promote a true behavioral change, the citizens need to feel part of the process. Gamification has proved to be effective in raising citizens’ awareness, encouraging their participation, and promoting a gradual but profound behavior change in various areas such as participatory governance, tourism, culture, education, etc. Gamification can also propel a Smart Living Society 5.0 among the younger groups of the society, especially in the context of academic communities that are more knowledgeable and eager to foster a healthier, more sustainable, and more inclusive society. Smart Living Society 5.0 is an activity in the scope of the TECH - Tecnologia, Ambiente, Criatividade e Saúde - a project of NORTE 2020, focusing on creating an Academic MaaS (AMaaS). At this stage, it is essential to know about gamification use cases related to new mobility solutions and practices. The paper presents successful cases of mobility systems and services that consider gamification to promote and incentivize their use concerning active mobility and sustainable mobility; it discusses the potential of gamified systems to achieve a gamification proposal approach to implement in the AMaaS under development. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",AMaaS; Gamification; Maas; Mobility; Smart living,,,,,,"European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, (Norte-01–0145-FEDER-000043)","Acknowledgments.

The research was carried out during two academic years, with the same class group. It was started from a traditional model in an initial point. It was continued to an intermediate cycle in which a Flipped Learning model was implemented. Finally, the model was improved with an educational platform that integrated gamification elements (Classcraft). The evidences were analysed from the cognitive dimension, the social dimension and the motivational dimension, to compare the results of each cycle. The improvements are produced sequentially from the initial point. The best results are achieved in terms of academic performance, participation and motivation of students, social interaction and addresses diversity in the last cycle. © 2022 Universidad de Sevilla.

A systematic literature review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement was conducted. To provide complete and valid information, all types of related studies for all educational stages and subjects throughout the years were investigated. In total, 670 articles from 5 databases (Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, IEEE, and ERIC) were examined. Based on the results, using augmented reality and gamification in education can yield several benefits for students, assist educators, improve the educational process, and facilitate the transition toward technology-enhanced learning when used in a student-centered manner, following proper educational approaches and strategies and taking students’ knowledge, interests, unique characteristics, and personality traits into consideration. Students demonstrated positive behavioral, attitudinal, and psychological changes and increased engagement, motivation, active participation, knowledge acquisition, focus, curiosity, interest, enjoyment, academic performance, and learning outcomes. Teachers also assessed them positively. Virtual rewards were crucial for improving learning motivation. The need to develop appropriate validation tools, design techniques, and theories was apparent. Finally, their potential to create collaborative and personalized learning experiences and to promote and enhance students’ cognitive and social–emotional development was evident. © 2022 by the authors.

In this context, gamification is a methodology that, in the teaching field, favors the involvement of students in their learning thanks to playful components that keep the participants motivated. In this work we analyze a comprehensive gamification experience for students of various engineering degrees designed for face-to-face teaching and its adaptation to the online environment. The main results observed were the existence of a correlation between the active participation of the student in the program and taking the exam, as well as an improvement in the learning of the concepts and methods of solving problems of the subject, which resulted in an increase in the percentage of students who passed the subject with respect to the total number of students who took the exam when comparing them with the control groups. The students' perception of the experience indicates that they feel more committed to the subject and consider that it has served to improve their learning. © 2023 Universidad de CÃ¡diz y AsociaciÃ³n de Profesores Amigos de la Ciencia.

This paper presents a systematic review of representative literature dealing with online participation in education. All subscribed resources in Web of Science were systematically searched with no time frame limit, and a total of 30 relevant studies published between 1996 and 2020 were selected. Proposed classification of a variety of approaches that evidently enhance and encourage online participation is based on actual empirical results and evidences reported in each analysed study. The key research findings revealed that different communication support (like discussion forums, blogs, and chats) and teaching strategies (like flipped learning, personalized communication, and gamification) were evidenced as predominantly employed approaches which proved to enhance online participation. Besides, facilitative strategies and tools (like online peer voting, wikis, and blogs) along with other support mechanisms (like social media and group awareness tools) were also regarded as valuable means of participation encouragement. Furthermore, in a great majority of analysed research, university students were found to be involved participants (in terms of data collection), while half of studies relied on Learning Management System as supporting technology. The conducted review exposed also a significant empirical evidence to support the argument that students’ learning performance could be enhanced by improving online participation.

This initiative promotes the creativity of new generations of students in the digital society of the 21 st century, encouraging the use of new technologies and giving visibility to their talent and digital skills. The relevance of our proposal lies both in its novelty and in its generalizability to other university contexts that might be interested in providing active mechanisms that incentivize participation, and in particular, impel the engagement of the individuals in a technological setup. To date, no study has formally stated and examined this theoretical framework. In doing so, the research conducted in this study provides useful recommendations and insights for the academy. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Crowdsourcing; Digital society; Engagement; Gamification; Higher education,,,,,,"Government of Extremadura; European Regional Development Fund, FEDER, (GR15044); Junta de Extremadura","Funding text 1: We would like to acknowledge the funding of the European Regional Development Fund [N.

However, there are no dedicated games to deliver complete clinical-anatomy content at an undergraduate level. AIM: This study describes the developmental process of a series of anatomy games for medical students and analyses student participation and experiences around the gamification process. METHODS: Three diverse anatomy games were developed on the undergraduate medical curriculum. Based on students’ playing and simultaneous learning experiences in each game, subsequent game contents were constructively modified. Students from three different universities participated in the study (total cohort=646); their experiences on the different games were documented and compared with each other. RESULTS: Feedback from 219 players showed that the games were fun (95%) and interesting (81%) and assisted their anatomy learning (97%); students’ fun, interest and learning improved significantly in the two subsequent games (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Carefully designed anatomy games create a fun-filled and interesting learning environment for undergraduate medical students. Learning experiences improved when students’ feedback was appropriately addressed to constructively modify the subsequent learning resources. © NZMA.",,"Anatomy; Curriculum; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Gamification; Humans; Learning; New Zealand; Students, Medical; article; curriculum; development; gamification; human; human experiment; learning; learning environment; medical education; medical student; anatomy; education; learning; medical education; medical student; New Zealand",,,,,Otago School of Biomedical Sciences Medical Education; University of Otago’s Committee for the Advancement of Learning and Teaching,"Methods Undergraduate medical students from three universities (University of Otago, New Zealand (n=300); Manipal University, India (n=72); Khon Kaen University, Thailand (n=274)) were invited to participate in this study. All three universities teach human anatomy following traditional methods that include didactic lectures, cadaver dissections or prosections; gamification is not a regular mode of anatomy-education delivery at any of the three universities. Institutional approval was obtained for the study from all universities; the project was partly funded by the University of Otago’s Committee for the Advancement of Learning and Teaching grant and the Otago School of Biomedical Sciences Medical Education Research Grant.","Charles T, Bustard D, Black M., Experiences of promoting student engagement through game-enhanced learning, Serious games and edutainment applications, pp. 425-446, (2011);

Students should be prepared for the future and more extensive requirements in the labour market. Basic competences acquired during the obligatory lessons are not sufficient any-more. Students need entrepreneurial skills like the ability to work in teams, a sense of responsibility and self-reliance, as well as organizational skills. These skills also need to be interdisciplinary. That’s the reason, the Higher College for Engineering Wolfsberg (short “HTL Wolfsberg”) is forcing entrepreneurial activities to prepare the students for the future. The aim is that everyone should gain the key set of competences needed for personal development, social inclusion, active citizenship and employment. We increasingly focus on business games and participation in competitions. Furthermore, cooperations with business experts and funding agencies enable valuable input for our students. This guarantees good support for the entrepreneurs of the future. Due to the COVID 19 situation we were forced to practice distance learning. It is hard to imagine entrepreneurial subjects can be teached online – but we broke new ground with specific online games. This paper gives an overview on activities and didactical approaches used by the Higher College for Engineering Wolfsberg within the last years in order to explore the entrepreneurial mindset of their students. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Business games; Competitions; Didactical approaches; Entrepreneurship; Gamification,Distance education; Employment; Business games; Entrepreneurial activity; Entrepreneurial skills; Funding agencies; Organizational skills; Personal development; Social inclusion; Work in teams; Students,,,,,,,Europe; Skills Austria; Moonshot Pirates,"M.

An extended gamified simulation was developed as a capstone activity for a new Australian Bachelor of Pharmacy (BPharm) program. The simulation was designed to consolidate students' knowledge, skills, and behaviors from prior learning. This research aimed to explore whether participation in an extended gamified simulation could influence pharmacy students' perceptions of their professional competencies. Methods: Data were collected over three years to compare a superseded Master of Pharmacy (MPharm) program with an incoming BPharm program. Final year students were invited to self-assess their professional competencies at the start and end of their final semester of study, using a digital self-assessment tool which replicated Australia's National Competency Standards Framework for Pharmacists. Participants rated their own competency against the 26 competency standards across five domains on a five-point Likert scale (not at all competent to very competent). This provided pre- and post-data to compare the simulation (BPharm intervention) and a traditional semester (MPharm comparison), in addition to final course grades. Results: From 2016 to 2019, 85 (90.4%) of 94 intervention and 50 (83.3%) of 60 comparison students completed the self-assessment of professional competencies. Participation in the gamified simulation significantly improved students' pharmacotherapeutics grades and pre-post change scores for seven of the 26 competency standards, two of the five domains, and all domains combined of the National Competency Standards. Conclusions: An extended, gamified simulation enhances the development of pharmacy students' self-assessed professional competencies. © 2022",Competence; Competency-based education; Gamification; Pharmacy education; Professional development; Simulation,adult; article; Australia; controlled study; curriculum; female; gamification; human; human experiment; Likert scale; major clinical study; male; perception; pharmacist; pharmacy education; pharmacy student; professional development; self evaluation; simulation,,,,,,,"Koster A., Schalekamp T., Meijerman I., Implementation of competency-based pharmacy education (CBPE), Pharmacy (Basel), 5, 1, (2017); Katoue M.G., Schwinghammer T.L., Competency-based education in pharmacy: a review of its development, applications, and challenges, J Eval Clin Pract, 26, 4, pp. 1114-1123, (2020); Volmer D., Sepp K., Veski P., Raal A., The implementation of pharmacy competence teaching in Estonia, Pharmacy (Basel), 5, 2, (2017); Croft H., Gilligan C., Rasiah R., Levett-Jones T., Schneider J., Current trends and opportunities for competency assessment in pharmacy education–a literature review, Pharmacy (Basel), 7, 2, (2019); Nash R.E., Chalmers L., Brown N., Jackson S., Peterson G., An international review of the use of competency standards in undergraduate pharmacy education, Pharm Educ, 15, (2015); Nash R., Chalmers L., Stupans I., Brown N., Developing lifelong learning skills: Using a traffic light report to promote competency standards and self-assessment among pharmacy undergraduates, Ensuring Quality in Professional Education Volume I, pp. 209-240, (2019); Bruno A., Bates I., Brock T., Anderson C., Towards a global competency framework, Am J Pharm Educ, 74, 3, (2010); Bruno-Tome A., Ortner Hadziabdic M., Mucalo I., Rennie T., Competency (and beyond): think patient. collaborate. develop. evaluate. improve. repeat, Pharmacy (Basel), 7, 4, (2019); International Pharmaceutical Federation, Pharmacy Education Taskforce - A Global Competency Framework; Al-Haqan A., Smith F., Bader L., Bates I., Competency development for pharmacy: adopting and adapting the Global Competency Framework, Res Social Adm Pharm, 17, 4, pp. 771-785, (2021); Arakawa N., Yamamura S., Duggan C., Bates I., The development of a foundation-level pharmacy competency framework: an analysis of country-level applicability of the Global Competency Framework, Res Social Adm Pharm, 16, 3, pp. 396-404, (2020); Stupans I., Atkinson J., Mestrovic A., Nash R., Rouse M.J., A shared focus: comparing the Australian, Canadian, United Kingdom and United States pharmacy learning outcome frameworks and the global competency framework, Pharmacy (Basel), 4, 3, (2016); National Competency Standards Framework for Pharmacists in Australia, Pharmaceutical Society of Australia, (2016); Continuing professional development, Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency and National Boards.

The participants were 90 distance students registered in two courses of an English Integrated Skills class, which is included in the English Major offered by Universidad Tecnica Particular de Loja. The students belonged to an A2 level according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). The research was conducted through a mixed approach in which a diagnostic questionnaire was first administered to determine the participants' learning needs. Subsequently, a pedagogical intervention was carried out by two instructors for a 14-week period. This process included academic monitoring and personalized feedback. At this intervention, 30 matching audiogames were carefully designed and used in both courses. Once this stage finished, a students' perceptions questionnaire was applied and an interview was conducted to teachers who were in charge of using these games as a supplementary resource in their classes. The results demonstrated that gamification through audiogames is highly effective since they have the potential to strengthen both, productive and receptive English as a Foreign Language (EFL) skills, especially the listening ability. In addition, the use of audiogames improves students' learning experience, encourages autonomous learning, and helps them to be actively involved in academic activities, thus improving their attention, participation and reflection. © 2020 IEEE.",audiogames; English language; Gamification; higher education,Strategic planning; Surveys; Teaching; Academic activities; Autonomous learning; Distance students; English-as-a-Foreign-Language; Integrated skills; Personalized feedback; Students' learning experiences; Teaching English as a foreign languages; Students,,,,,,,"Rodriguez C.A.C., Gamificacion en educacion superior: Experiencia innovadora para motivar estudiantes y dinamizar contenidos en el aula, Edutec.

They take advantage of a set of tools to encourage people to engage with them just for the joy of playing and the possibility to win. While gamification is gaining ground in a lot of areas in our society, its application in education is still an emerging trend. In recent years, gamification has attracted the attention of researchers from different areas such as teaching and learning computer programming. Ever since the first programming languages emerged, the problems inherent to programming teaching and learning have been studied and investigated. The theme is very serious, not only for the important concepts underlying computer science courses but also for reducing the lack of motivation, failure, and abandonment that result from student frustration. In most of these studies and research one factor prevails, lack of student motivation or how to motivate students to learn programming. One way to combat this problem is to use gamification. Using game design elements in non-game contexts is one of the good ways to motivate and encourage students to learn programming. To assess how gamification impacted the learning experience, we compared data from one gamified and non-gamified year. In general, the results show significant improvements in terms of attendance to class, participation, and proactivity. They also suggest that our approach can reduce the high rate of failure grade among students. In conclusion, this case study, we show how the use of concepts related to gamification can improve motivation, passion, beauty, joy, awe, e naturally the succeed in programming. © 2020 IEEE.",Gamification; Learning programming; Programming problems; Teaching programming,Engineering education; Gamification; Motivation; Outages; Problem oriented languages; Teaching; Computer Science course; Emerging trends; ITS applications; Learning experiences; Pro activities; Programming teaching; Student motivation; Teaching and learning; Students,,,,,,,"Dekhane S., Xu X., Tsoi M.Y., Mobile app development to increase student engagement and problem solving skills, J.

For this purpose, a quasi-experimental study was conducted with a sample of 101 undergraduate students of education who participated in online Kahoot quizzes by designing their own questions as part of the formative assessment. According to the results of the pre-and post-tests, the integration of this game-based student response system into the teaching process improved students' perception of certain concepts in social science teaching, increased their active participation in the lesson, and motivated them towards learning in a more interactive and stimulating environment. Therefore, it is recommended to take gamification to a whole new level with attractive digital participation platforms to increase motivation and enhance students' learning experience in higher education contexts. © 2020 by the authors.

Therefore, the main objectives of this research are (1) to contextually understand the university interns' perception of ICT Techs (MALL, Gamification, and VR) in teaching English for secondary school students during the Covid-19 Pandemic in Malaysia, and (2) to determine which of these ICT Techs (MALL, Gamification, and VR) would be most preferred by the interns for teaching English to secondary school students in Malaysia. The research design for this study was quantitative and a web-based questionnaire was adapted from three articles (Mihaela Badea, 2015; Huseyin Oz, 2015; and Ali Rahimi, Niloofar Seyed Golshan & Hooman Mohebi, 2013). The reliability test indicated a value of 0.866 with Cronbach's Alpha reliability statistic. From a total of 63 university interns selected from a private university in Malaysia, the results indicated that 38.1% chose MALL, 33% chose Gamification, and 29% chose VR, as their preferred technology to teach English for secondary school students during this Covid-19 Pandemic in Malaysia. Evidence suggested that online learning can be more effective for students where they can control their own learning pace, compared to learning in a classroom environment. Thus, future English teachers should explore and apply innovative pedagogical methods in the teaching-learning process during pandemic outbreak in Malaysia, while contributing to the development of motivation, participation, and engagement among secondary school students in acquiring the English language. © 2020 by authors.",COVID-19 Pandemic; English Language; Gamification; MALL; Secondary School Students; VR,,,,,,,,"Ahmadi D., The Use of Technology in English Language Learning: A Literature Review, International Journal of Research in English Education, 3, 2, pp. 115-125, (2018); Arikan A., Effectiveness of using games in teaching grammar to young learners, (2011); Azar A.

Systems providing such kind of service are built around an interface, allowing to administer the tasks (exercises to train programming skills), and show the results, accompanied by meaningful feedback. To produce such results, they apply techniques ranging from static analysis of program correctness, to testing-based evaluation. These systems can also support Competitive Programming, which is known to have educational meaning too. We developed the 2TSW system, supporting the automated correction of computer programming tasks, in a gamified web-based environment. The system let the student access a list of assignments (programming tasks), submit solutions to them, and have such solutions tested and graded. Accomplished tasks let the student gain experience points, represented also by medals, recognition of mastery on a topic, and improvements on a personal characterization of the student's status. The personal profile allows the student to monitor her/his proceedings and achievements. The gamified structure of the system, together with the availability of real-time automated assessment, offers the opportunity for an increasing level of students' personal engagement and motivation. Here we describe the system, and report on an experimentation, where students of a Bachelor Programme in Computer Engineering, first year, used 2TSW. In particular, we 1) present findings about the students' feedback, coming from a questionnaire administered after the experience, and 2) provide the reader with an analysis of the participation data, based on simple statistic tests. The students' feedback let us conclude that they appreciated the 2TSW gamified experience, perceived the system as useful, and maintained a high level of engagement. The data analysis allowed for less decisive conclusions, although it showed proof of the effectiveness of the system as a learning aid. © 2021 The Authors",Automated assessment; Computer programming learning; Gamification; Testing,,,,,,,,"Agapito J., Rodrigo M.M., Designing an intervention for novice programmers based on meaningful gamification: An Expert evaluation, Proc. 25th int.

The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of incorporating gamification on knowledge acquisition. BACKGROUND: Nursing administrators should support the use of gamification to improve the nurses' acquisition of knowledge. The clinical educators traditionally utilize lecture-based educational offerings preventing students from active participation. Gamification promotes learner engagement, critical thinking, and enjoyment. METHODS: A quasi-experimental study design with a 230-person convenience sample compared the knowledge acquisition of nurses before and after new hire orientation and basic electrocardiogram course. Technology purchased included iPad, GoPro, mobile apps, and websites. RESULTS: Incorporating gamification technology resulted in an increase in knowledge acquisition and engagement of learners. CONCLUSION: Findings demonstrate gamification as an effective way to increase knowledge acquisition when compared with traditional methods. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

One teaching approach that embodies these essential characteristics of learning is gamification. Gamification is the application of gamified thinking and game mechanics to solve problems and increase engagement (Çeker & Özdam, 2017) [1]. Gamification is characterized by its ability to achieve cognitive, emotional, and behavioral effects by giving students opportunities to improve their critical thinking skills, arouse their feelings of curiosity, and increase active participation, respectively. However, considering gamification as an approach for education and learning is still a controversial subject. It is our position of this paper that as educators, we believe that gamification engages learners, motivates them to learn, satisfy their needs, and transfers knowledge by fun tasks. © 2022.

The transformations in educational environments are becoming more and more important for project-based and student-centered design education model. Understanding the needs and expectations of the changing student profile has become essential for design education, which puts new and original outputs as the main objective. Students’ expectations of having a say in their own learning environments also provide an important opportunity for them to play an active role in the focus of this change. The aim of this study is to determine the design criteria of a new learning tool in line with the needs and expectations of the new generation industrial design students with a student-oriented approach. Participatory Design workshops were organized to expose expectations of the current learners about a new Design Brief in a digital and online medium.

It provides a critical perspective on the future of MOOCs in Europe and provides several comparisons with other existing models and platforms. The book contains chapters that address the major issues connected to MOOC design and implementation. The first 8 chapters cover large issues that extend beyond the ECO project experience, such as creative industries and trans-literacy; management and implementation; learning environments and platforms; dissemination; pedagogical models; interactivity and agility; gamification; evaluation; and business models. The last 3 chapters hone in on narrowly focused topics such as mobility, knowledge transfer and peer to peer evaluation. The specificities of this on-going project (funded by the EU) are: a unique collaborative pedagogy, an intercultural process (6 languages), and focus on intercreativity, the multiplying impact of e-teachers (the community of participants that was empowered to create more than 50 new MOOCs), accessibility and gamification. The book will be of interest due to its holistic approach to MOOCs and its assessment of their opportunities and their limitations. Many issues are explored and contribute to deeper understanding of the phenomenon and its transformative capacities for education and learning. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.",Agile Methods in Virtual Education; Communities of Practice Online; Democratization of Knowledge; E-learning platforms; E-learning through Mobile Devices; Gamification in Educational Processes; Knowledge Transfer via MOOCs; Learning Environments in MOOCs; Massive Open Online Courses; Online Competences in MOOCs; Online Culture of Participation; Virtual Learning Spaces,,,,,,,,,,,Springer International Publishing,,,,,,,978-303067314-7; 978-303067313-0,,,English,MOOCs and the Particip.

Besides their utility as proof of achievement, badges are of interest in higher education as pure incentives to push the students and learners in general toward pursuing well-defined goals and skills. In this respect, badges can be naturally incorporated into digital learning platforms also as part of informal learning activities, and stimulate participation, merit, and visibility for the students. However, the level of engagement of learners into these learning activities depends crucially on how the system of badges and rewards has been designed and on how it is applied, if it is to be used effectively. In this paper, we report on the design and implementation of a smart badges system, and an example of its use inside a gamification methodology for informal learning in a master level course, and discuss the benefits and the observed gains in learning performance that can be obtained. © 2021 by the authors.

Medical schools and residency programs placed restrictions on bedside teaching and clinical scanning as part of risk mitigation. In response, POCUS faculty from 15 institutions nationwide collaborated on an alternative model of ultrasound education, A Distance-learning Approach to POCUS Training (ADAPT). Approach ADAPT was repeated monthly from April 1 through June 30, 2020. It accommodated 70 learners, who included 1- to 4-week rotators and asynchronous learners. The curriculum included assigned prework and learning objectives covering 20 core POCUS topics. A rotating group of 30 faculty and fellows delivered daily virtual teaching sessions that included gamification to increase learner engagement and hands-on instruction through teleguidance. After participation, faculty and learners completed anonymous surveys. Outcomes Educators reported a significant decrease in preparatory time (6.2 vs 3.1 hours per week, P <.001) dedicated to ultrasound education after implementing ADAPT. The majority of 29 learners who completed surveys felt ""somewhat confident""or ""very confident""in their ability to acquire (n = 25, 86.2%) and interpret (n = 27, 93.1%) ultrasound images after the intervention; the majority of 22 educators completing surveys rated the program ""somewhat effective""or ""very effective""at contributing to learner's ability to acquire (n = 13, 59.1%) and interpret (n = 20, 90.9%) images. Most learners (n = 28, 96.6%) and all educators (n = 22, 100%) were ""satisfied""or ""very satisfied""with ADAPT as a whole, and the large majority of educators were ""very likely""(n = 18, 81.8%) to recommend continued use of this program. Next Steps A virtual curriculum that pools the efforts of multiple institutions nationwide was implemented rapidly and effectively while satisfying educational expectations of both learners and faculty. This collaborative framework can be replicated and may be generalizable to other educational objectives.  © 2021 by the Association of American Medical Colleges.",,"COVID-19; Curriculum; Education, Distance; Humans; Internship and Residency; Point-of-Care Testing; Program Evaluation; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires; Ultrasonography; curriculum; echography; education; human; medical education; point of care testing; procedures; program evaluation; questionnaire",,,,,,,"Rose S., Medical student education in the time of COVID-19., JAMA, 323, pp. 2131-2132, (2020); Chick R.C., Clifton G.T., Peace K.M., Using technology to maintain the education of residents during the COVID-19 pandemic., J Surg Educ, 77, pp. 729-732, (2020); Damewood S.C., Leo M., Bailitz J., Tools for measuring clinical ultrasound competency: Recommendations from the Ultrasound Competency Work Group., AEM Educ Train, 4, pp. S106-S112, (2019); Mallin M., Schlein S., Doctor S., Stroud S., Dawson M., Fix M., A survey of the current utilization of asynchronous education among emergency medicine residents in the United States., Acad Med, 89, pp. 598-601, (2014); Stuntz R., Clontz R., An evaluation of emergency medicine core content covered by free open access medical education resources., Ann Emerg Med, 67, pp. 649-653, (2016); Winn S., McKeown P., Lotfipour S., Remote, synchronous, hands-on ultrasound education., Telemed J e Health, 21, pp. 593-597, (2015); Soon A.W., Toney A.G., Stidham T., Kendall J., Roosevelt G., Teaching point-of-care lung ultrasound to novice pediatric learners: Web-based e-learning versus traditional classroom didactic., Pediatr Emerg Care, 36, pp. 317-321, (2020); Haskins S.C., Feldman D., Fields K.G., Teaching a point-of-care ultrasound curriculum to anesthesiology trainees with traditional didactic lectures or an online E-learning platform: A pilot study., J Educ Perioper Med, 20, (2018); Filler L., Orosco D., Rigdon D., Evaluation of a novel curriculum on point-of-care ultrasound competency and confidence., Emerg Radiol, 27, pp. 37-40, (2020); Braun V., Clarke V., Using thematic analysis in psychology., Qual Res Psychol, 3, pp. 77-101, (2006)","K.

The initiative, a narrative-based simulation of a condensed student journey from pre-enrolment to graduation, is designed to prepare and support students in their transition to and participation in Higher Education. Student retention continues to be a perennial issue across the Higher Education sector, and studies have indicated that the more knowledgeable and informed students are about their university environment, the less likely they are to leave before completing their studies. Many institutions have developed interventions with the express purpose of addressing these concerns. Recognising the contextualised and subjective nature of such interventions, a realist evaluative framework was adopted to better understand the initiative under scrutiny, asking what works, for whom and in what circumstances. Participant interviews were utilised to assess the efficacy of the initiative in supporting students and in helping them to navigate often unfamiliar institutional cultures, practices and expectations. A revised programme theory is presented, enabling deeper insight into the merit of the initiative and its overall worth as a mechanism for change within the ARPA paradigm. © 2022 D.

Notably there has been a significant increase in the use of digital technology applications to meet this challenge. For instance, in the first quarter of 2020 the game-based software Kahoot! reported a threefold increase in players and a fivefold increase in asynchronous learning globally. However, there is limited research into the use of game-based digital technology applications such as Kahoot! and the associated learning theories, particularly in histology, anatomy, and medical education. This scoping review explored the utilization, outcome scores, and student perceptions of learning with the application of Kahoot! in histology, anatomy, and medical education. Online databases were used to identify articles published between 2013 and 2021 from which 12 articles were included in the review. The majority of articles supported positive student outcomes including improved collaborative learning, improved knowledge of content, attendance, and participation. Minor negative aspects included increased time on task, overwhelming learning content, and distractions due to gadgets. None of the articles included a control group. The main educational theories identified were active learning followed by social and constructivism learning theory. In light of the Covid-19 pandemic a rapid and fundamental shift in how digital applications are being used in educational institutions has evolved. Further research on learning frameworks and studies with control groups is required to evaluate Kahoot! as a potentially valuable online application in histology, anatomy, and medical education. © 2021 American Association for Anatomy",Covid-19; digital technology; educational games; game-based software; gamification; gross anatomy education; histology education; Kahoot!; teaching and learning,"Anatomy; COVID-19; Education, Medical; Humans; Pandemics; Perception; SARS-CoV-2; Students; anatomy; education; human; medical education; pandemic; perception; student",,,,,,,"Australian Bureau of Statistics.

Pedagogical models such as Flipped Learning and active methodologies such as Project-Based Learning and Gamification have a relevant role in education. Objectives. (1) To identify the variables of teaching practices, ratios, and mathematics teacher training indicators that could influence the choice of different study models or methodologies. Method. A total of 73 teachers from the Autonomous City of Melilla were included in a cross-sectional study. Teachers filled out a validated questionnaire with 35 questions regarding mathematics and teacher training, information and communication technology (ICT) uses, resources and mastery, communication, and collaboration. Results. The statistical analyses revealed significant positive influences between the Flipped Learning model, Project-Based Learning, and Gamification with the evaluated items. Furthermore, Project-Based Learning showed a negative association with two items of the teaching practice indicator. Conclusion. The exchange of information and content through online spaces, participation, and collaboration in center projects related to digital technologies and educational software to teach mathematics had a significant impact on the choice of Flipped Learning model and active methodologies. © 2021 by the authors.

Too often, there is an immense disconnect between the aspirations of inhabitants and the realities of these spaces (cities, towns etc.). These spaces effect every aspect of human existence from healthcare, education to overall well-being of inhabitants. In this paper, we introduce a novel gamified experience called IkigaiLand, that allows users to reconstruct existent localities to better reflect their expectations and aspirations while equipping them with tangible information about planning and infrastructure in their own surroundings. It also allows relevant authorities to better understand the collective needs of citizens/residents of the area and prospectively utilize their generated solutions. Special consideration has been made to make the solution accessible, inclusive and democratized to incorporate diversity in opinion and participation. The game employs the use of tokenised entities such as buildings and an Augmented Reality(AR) application all encapsulated within gamified interactions to allow users to visualise and quantify the resilience and effectiveness of their constructed cities. We envisage this gamified experience as a tool for collective dreaming that allows communities to better articulate and facilitate innovation in the space of urban planning.  © 2020 ACM.",Augmented Reality; Cities; Participatory Planning; Urban Planning,Augmented reality; Gamification; Human computer interaction; Participatory planning; Town planning; Well being; Urban planning,,,,,,,"Murtagh B., Listening to Communities: Locality Research and Planning, Urban Studies, 36, 7, pp. 1181-1193, (1999); From Participatory Design to a Listening Infrastructure: A Case of Urban Planning and Participation September 2015 Journal of Business and Technical Communication, 30, 1; Sudeept M., De Faria J.V., Icipatory planning processes in Indian cities: Its challenges and opportunities, Journal of Sustainable Urbanization, Planning and Progress, 2, 1, pp. 1-17, (2017); Archigram Archives the Archigram Portfolio Collection; Poplin A., Games and Serious Games in Urban Planning: Study Cases, Computational Science and Its Applications-ICCSA 2011., 6783, (2011); Making Tangible the Intangible: Hybridization of the Real and the Virtual to Enhance Learning of Abstract Phenomena, (2016); Van Holstein E., Experiences of Participatory Planning in Contexts of Inequality: A Qualitative Study of Urban Renewal Projects in Colombia, Planning Theory & Practice, 19, 1, pp. 39-57, (2018)",,,Association for Computing Machinery,balsamiq; copods; frog; NMIMS School of Design; proto.io; TECHVED,"11th Indian Conference on Human-Computer Interaction, IndiaHCI 2020",5 November 2020 through 8 November 2020,"Virtual, Online",166134,,978-145038944-0,,,English,ACM Int.

The use of elements of games in non-recreational environments (gamification) may be a possible solution, since research indicates an improvement in user experience and engagement, with possibilities of improved motivation and behavioral results. However not all studies obtain positive results, the success of gamification is influenced by the design, the sample, and the context. This study analyzes a gamification design with the most common elements in three methodological approaches (teacher-centered, student-centered, and mixed) in three different periods throughout a program of study with vocational training students. The results indicate that the mixed approach performed worse than the other two. Carrying out a greater number of tasks did not imply a better result in the subject marks, but rather paying more attention to each task influences the result positively. © 2021 by the authors.

Therefore, if higher education wants to educate students properly for a successful career path, the business and economics curriculum must be enriched with innovative teaching approaches covering actual topics, such as, for example, the implementation of the ERPsim business simulation, a representative of serious games. The ERPsim business simulation is based on SAP ERP, and is aimed at teaching ERP concepts. It covers different business processes, and allows students to learn using a hands-on approach, simulating real-life scenarios. The presented research focuses on using an ERPsim business simulation as the introduction to the course. The simulation was implemented to ease the introduction of ERP and IT concepts to the business and economic oriented students. Considering the positive effects of serious games and gamification, our research was formed and focused on knowledge acquisition and future student engagement. We researched whether participation in the introductory simulation results in significant knowledge gain and impacts students’ future course engagement. The data were gathered using a self-assessment questionnaire before and after an introductory simulation. The results were highly positive, confirming many positive aspects of business simulation, among others, significant knowledge increase in the domains of business process and ERP transactions, and in the domain of technical knowledge for SAP ERP. The results confirmed that the introductory simulation is appropriate for introducing ERP concepts to newcomers, and, nevertheless, confirmed the positive impact on their intent on future course engagement. © 2022 by the authors.

The definitions of the game and its significance and function are presented through the prism of modernist and postmodernist views, that is, sociological and psychological theories about the game. Motivation for participation in games is elaborated by means of the theory of self-determination, and the connection between motivation and inclination towards endless and final games is explained by Habermas' theory of communicative action. In addition to general scientific methods, a survey method is used to collect data utilising an online questionnaire (with a semi-closed answer system), an instrument created through the Google Forms application. Measurement, typology, and statistical method (processing of data by SPSS), along with a comparative method for interpretation of results, are used for arranging and presenting data. The sample formed is random and stratified, consisting of 221 examinees from the student population. With regard to the initial three hypotheses, two of them are fully confirmed, while the third one is only partially confirmed, with scientific description, scientific understanding, and scientific explanation having been realised in the former, the latter featuring only scientific description. The results indicate that most students: 1) have an excellent knowledge (familiarity) and positive (postmodernist) attitudes towards the game, its importance, and functions; 2) participate in the game for intrinsic motives, because they come from CRSP, in order to connect and communicate with others, so the socialiser's motive is the most dominant one; 3) participate in endless (affiliative, assertive) games. So it is encouraging that their awareness of and their being informed on the matter are at a very high level, that is, in the spirit of postmodernist discourse on the developmental potentials of the game for effective applications in a wide range of activities, especially in terms of life-long learning. Hence, we point out the importance of recognising and applying the principles of the game in higher education, more precisely the innovation of (electronic) game-based learning (gamification). © 2021, National Defence University - Carol I Printing House.

Traditional sex education teaching methodologies are limiting for digital nativesexposed to various digital technologies. Harnessing the power of technology applications attractive to the younger generationmay be a useful approach for teaching sex education.Objective: The aim of this study was to improve sexual health knowledge and understanding of the problems associated withunhealthy sexual practices and address sexual and reproductive health challenges experienced in a low-Tech setting.Methods: A participatory design approach was used to develop the digital gamified methodology. A sample of 120 secondaryschool students aged 11-15 were randomly assigned to either experimental or control group for each of the 3 teaching approaches:(1) gamified instruction (actual serious games [SG] in teaching); (2) gamification (GM; making nongames, such as game-likelearning); and (3) traditional teaching (TT) methods.Results: The SG and GM approaches were more effective than TT methods in teaching sexual health education. Specifically,the average scores across groups demonstrated an increase of mean scores from the pre-to posttest (25.10 [SD 5.50] versus 75.86[SD 13.16]; t119=41.252; P<.001 [2 tailed]). Analysis of variance indicated no significant differences across groups for pretestscores (F2,117=1.048, P=.35). Significant differences across groups were evident in the posttest scores. Students in the SG andGM groups had higher average scores than the TT group (F2,117=83.98; P<.001). Students reported increased learning motivation,attitude, know-how, and participation in learning (P<.001) when using SG and GM approaches.Conclusions: Digital health technologies (particularly teaching and learning through gamified instruction and other novelapproaches) may improve sexual health education. These findings may also be applied by practitioners in health care settingsand by researchers wishing to further the development of sex education. © 2021. KJMIR Publications Inc..

This is because it allows the expression of several problems related to digital design, artificial intelligence, databases, compilers, and formal languages, among others, as a sequence of Boolean operations and variables, which can be dealt with by using Boolean algebra methods to optimize algorithms, minimize digital components, and so forth. This study presents a piece of web-based software, denominated as MiniBool, which has been developed with the objective of supporting the learning of Boolean algebra in a blended learning setting. This educational proposal gives students the opportunity to reinforce learning at any time and in any place. It additionally increases the learners’ motivation by including gamification, through the use of a ranking that shows the students’ level of participation. MiniBool was evaluated by means of a formal experiment, which was carried out with Discrete Mathematics students at a higher education institution in Mexico, where two groups were formed randomly: A control group, whose members attended classes and reinforced their knowledge in a traditional manner with a pencil and paper, and an experimental group, which learned in a blended learning context, receiving the same classes as the control group, but reinforcing what they had learned using MiniBool. The statistical results obtained indicate that the use of MiniBool has a positive and motivating effect on learning and that a greater academic performance is achieved than when the traditional teaching-learning method is applied. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC",blended learning; Boolean algebra; education; gamification; web-based education,Artificial intelligence; E-learning; Formal languages; Gamification; Learning systems; Motivation; Students; Websites; Academic performance; Discrete mathematics; Experimental groups; Formal Experiments; Higher education institutions; Reinforce learning; Teaching-learning method; Web-based softwares; Boolean algebra,,,,,"Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog?a; Jorge Arreygue; Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología, CONACYT","Funding text 1: The authors would like to thank Michel Olvera, Alan Cruz, and Jorge Arreygue for participating in the development of MiniBool.

One of them involves placing the student at the core of the teaching-learning process through the use of active methodologies. During the academic year 2018/2019, with this objective in mind, Gamification was introduced in the subject of Microeconomics as an innovative teaching experience. This was carried out through the use of Kahoot. At the end of the course, the experience was evaluated through an online questionnaire combined with the analysis of the academic results. In general, the innovative experience was positive for the students because it increased their motivation and participation in the classroom, and improved the learning process. The experience also positively affected final results of the participating students. © 2020 by IGI Global.",,,,,,,,,"Arnal J., Del Rincon D., De la Torre S., Investigación educativa, Revista de Investigación Educacional, 15, 2, pp. 145-178, (1992); Contreras R.S., Gamificación en aulas universitarias, (2016); Contreras R.S., Eguia J.L., Gamificación en escenarios educativos.

Objective: In this study, we introduced a novel tool, QualityIQ, and determined the extent to which it helps primary care physicians to align care decisions with the latest best practices included in the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS). Methods: We developed the fully automated QualityIQ patient simulation platform with real-time evidence-based feedback and gamified peer benchmarking. Each case included workup, diagnosis, and management questions with explicit evidence-based scoring criteria. We recruited practicing primary care physicians across the United States into the study via the web and conducted a cross-sectional study of clinical decisions among a national sample of primary care physicians, randomized to continuing medical education (CME) and non-CME study arms. Physicians ""cared"" for 8 weekly cases that covered typical primary care scenarios. We measured participation rates, changes in quality scores (including MIPS scores), self-reported practice change, and physician satisfaction with the tool. The primary outcomes for this study were evidence-based care scores within each case, adherence to MIPS measures, and variation in clinical decision-making among the primary care providers caring for the same patient. Results: We found strong, scalable engagement with the tool, with 75% of participants (61 non-CME and 59 CME) completing at least 6 of 8 total cases. We saw significant improvement in evidence-based clinical decisions across multiple conditions, such as diabetes (+8.3%, P<.001) and osteoarthritis (+7.6%, P=.003) and with MIPS-related quality measures, such as diabetes eye examinations (+22%, P<.001), depression screening (+11%, P<.001), and asthma medications (+33%, P<.001). Although the CME availability did not increase enrollment in the study, participants who were offered CME credits were more likely to complete at least 6 of the 8 cases. Conclusions: Although CME availability did not prove to be important, the short, clinically detailed case simulations with real-time feedback and gamified peer benchmarking did lead to significant improvements in evidence-based care decisions among all practicing physicians. © 2021 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Although studies of implementing gamification to facilitate language learning are drawing more and more attention, limited research has been conducted to explore the effects of gamification on FLA. By conducting semi-structured interviews, this paper investigated students' perceptions of gamification and their FLA in the preliminary stage of a gamified College English Listening and Speaking (ELS) class. Two major findings of this study are reported: 1) Students believe that gamification is helpful in visualizing their learning goals and creating a relaxing learning environment, but they can be frustrated by some complex game designs; 2) Students' FLA mainly comes from speaking English publicly, lacking preparation, fear of making mistakes, and introverted personality, and the alleviating effects of gamification can vary according to the sources and levels of students' FLA. For students who feel anxious due to their introverted personality or lacking preparation, the effect of gamification on reducing anxiety is less obvious. For students with lower anxiety levels, gamification alleviates their feelings of embarrassment and nervousness and promotes their classroom participation in a relatively more remarkable way comparing to their counterparts. This study is expected to contribute to the literature of gamification and foreign language education by exploring the preliminary effects of gamification on language learners' anxiety and providing references for further longitudinal research. © 2021 ACM.",Foreign Language Anxiety; Game Elements; Gamification; Second Language Acquisition,Big data; Computer aided instruction; Gamification; College English; College students; Foreign language; Foreign language learning; Language learning; Learning environments; Longitudinal research; Semi structured interviews; Students,,,,,"Teaching Reform Project of Higher Education in Heilongjiang Province, (SJGY20190218); Youth Project of Philosophy and Social Sciences in Guangdong Province, (GD18YJY03)",This study is funded by the Youth Project of Philosophy and Social Sciences in Guangdong Province (GD18YJY03) and Teaching Reform Project of Higher Education in Heilongjiang Province (SJGY20190218).

COVID-19 has wholly disrupted the education system. Switching to e-learning could be the enabler to create a new, more effective method of educating students when correctly applied. This paper proposes an elearning platform based on 3D interaction using augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) designed to meet particular learning objectives divided into levels and subjects, which aims to facilitate the teaching process and administrative workload in schools. We provide details on the platform, VR and AR courses/exercises conception and implementation. Many concepts may be hard to explain in a classroom or visualise in a textbook, e.g., anatomical concepts, molecular structures, space phenomena, or complex abstract topics. The AR and VR technologies make it much easier to achieve, creating a rich, interactive experience that combines real and virtual worlds. VR that provides information through realistic 3D models in immersive environments can better present concepts and skills. Our main contribution is the integration of AR and VR interaction in the web; we develop courses/ exercises selected from the Algerian Ministry of Education and Teaching learning program based on 3D interaction in virtual and augmented scenes. We hope by the integration of VR and AR into education attempts to increase the level of participation and maybe even the understanding of abstract and complex concepts.  © 2021 IEEE.",3D Interaction; 3D modelling; Augmented Reality; COVID-19; e-Learning; Educational teaching; Engagement; Gamification; Virtual Reality,Augmented reality; E-learning; Education computing; Learning systems; Teaching; Virtual reality; 3D interactions; 3D models; 3d-modeling; COVID-19; E - learning; E-learning platforms; Educational teaching; Engagement; Gamification; Virtual reality interactions; 3D modeling,,,,,,,"Amara K., Ramzan N., Achour N., Belhocine M., Larbes C., Zenati N., A new method for facial and corporal expression recognition, 2018 IEEE 16th Intl Conf on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing, 16th Intl Conf on Pervasive Intelligence and Computing, 4th Intl Conf on Big Data Intelligence and Computing and Cyber Science and Technology Congress(DASC/PiCom/DataCom/CyberSciTech), pp. 446-450, (2018); Amara K., Ramzan N., Achour N., Belhocine M., Larbas C., Zenati N., Emotion recognition via facial expressions, 2018 IEEE/ACS 15th International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications (AICCSA), pp. 1-6, (2018); Amara K., Ramzan N., Zenati N., Djekoune O., Larbes C., Guerroudji M., Aouam D., Towards emotion recognition in immersive virtual environments: A method for facial emotion recognition, ICCSA 2021 Conference on Computer Science's Complex Systems and Their Applications 2021 2904 of CEUR Workshop Proceedings, (Germany), pp. 253-263, (2021); Guerroudji M.A., Ameur Z., New approaches for contrast enhancement of calcifications in mammography using morphological enhancement, Proceedings of the International Conference on Intelligent Information Processing, Security and Advanced Communication, pp. 1-5, (2015); Crosier J., Cobb S., Wilson J., Experimental comparison of virtual reality with traditional teaching methods for teaching radioactivity, Education and Information Technologies, 5, pp. 329-343, (2000); Eschenbrenner B., Nah F., Siau K., 3-d virtual worlds in education: Applications, benefits, issues, and opportunities, J.

Carlos Lazo 100, Mexico City, 01389, Mexico; Portuguez Castro M., Institute for the Future of Education, Tecnologico de Monterrey, Monterrey, 64849, Mexico","In the last year, educational experiences have become increasingly challenging due to teaching classes remotely. For this reason, it has been necessary to develop educational strategies that accompany the use of new technologies to maintain student interest. One of these methodologies is gamification, implemented in school environments more frequently due to the pandemic and whose impact on student motivation and engagement needs to be explored. The literature shows that student participation in these contexts should be increased when applying this methodology, where teachers can also provide greater support. This research proposes improving these aspects by developing a gamification strategy that can be easily replicated in other environments. This study was carried out for a chemistry course at a university in central Mexico. This proposal details the short-, medium-, and long-term bonuses which stimulated and motivated students and achieved specific objectives. We also present the quantitative results of a questionnaire applied to 48 engineering students to identify their perceptions of how gamification could increase motivation and engagement in learning the subject of chemistry. In addition, pre-and post-knowledge tests were applied to determine whether there were changes in the learning outcomes. The results indicated that gamification increased student motivation and engagement, improved attitudes, promoted actions such as keeping the camera on during lectures and regular attendance, and improved student grades. This study fills the need for planning strategies to help improve student motivation in online classes and proposes an instrument to measure the results. It can be helpful to those interested in applying or adapting it in other disciplines. © 2021 by the authors.

An intentional or convenience sample of students and teachers at five education centers in Spain where teachers incorporate gamification experiments in their classrooms was considered. Working from a multi-case study based on a mixed method, questionnaires and structured and semistructured interviews were applied, which allowed us to gather quantitative and qualitative data, to then conduct a process of triangulation. We ascertained that teachers and students cited multiple advantages of gamification, including increased participation and interaction in the classroom, motivation toward learning, and amusement in educational experiences. Such activities involve didactic elements, among them content and standards of learning assigned for the proper curricular level. © 2018.",Active learning; Collaborative learning; Digital learning; Educational communication; Gamification; Mandatory education,,,,,,,,"Aranda D., Navarro J.S., Tabernero C., Jóvenes y ocio digital.

One approach to reducing household food waste is through education campaigns. We recruited 501 households divided into three types of intervention groups and compared with a control group to better understand the efficacy of diverse education campaign approaches. Food waste interventions included a passive approach (handouts), a community engagement approach, and a gamification approach. We conducted waste audits, household surveys (pre-and post-intervention), and a focus group at the end of the campaign. The passive and gamification groups had similarly high levels of participation, while participation in the community group was very low. The passive group and the gamification group had higher self-reported awareness of food wasting after the campaign and lower food wastage than the control group. Waste audits found marginally significant differences between the game group and the control (p = 0.07) and no difference between the other campaign groups and the control group in edible food wasted. Frequent gamers were found to generate less edible food waste than infrequent gamers. We conclude that the evidence about the potential for gamification as an effective education change tool is promising and we recommend further study. © 2020 by the authors.

Poor Knowledge Sharing (KS) can deter the successful implementation of teaching expertise, and this can affect instructors' teaching performance and may result in lower levels of learner achievement than could otherwise be achieved. Therefore, there is a need to implement a knowledge management (KM) initiative that facilitates the sharing of teaching practices among university instructors. In order to address this issue, this paper proposes a comprehensive and practical Computer-based Teaching Practices Management System (TPMS) which aims to foster instructors' participation in KS practices by employing a gamification approach. A design science research methodology is adopted in order to understand what would drive instructors to share their knowledge; this information is used in order to map their behavior to system features. A qualitative evaluation of users' experiences of utilizing the proposed features shows that the instructors express satisfaction with the motivational affordances and feel that they were motivated to participate in knowledge sharing activities. © 2020 IEEE.",Design science;

It has been proposed as a solution in several domains, such as teaching, corporate training and healthy living. This paper presents the design and evaluation of the skill tree method which is a part of a gamified approach to motivate and support NEET-youth (Not in Education, Employment or Training) to leave their isolation and take steps towards better inclusion in society. The overall approach is based on two principles: 1) it targets adolescents with an interest in games 2); it utilizes their interest in games as the starting point for the intervention. Part of the intervention is based on a skill tree which maps in-game skills to out-of-game skills and visualizes the output so that the participant can become better aware of how their interest can drive personal development towards societal participation. The paper presents an evaluation of the skill tree method from the project staff perspective.

The goal of the project is to re-engage NEET-youth in society. The project is carried out in cooperation between a Swedish university and four municipalities. All participants in the project have given their written and informed consent to participate. One fundamental tenet for the project is that it takes its starting point in the participants 嬀 interest in games ?including technical as well as cultural aspects of games and playing games). The main idea is to build on this interest and make participants aware of how the knowledge and skills gained from this interest may form a basis for their future life and career. It is not expected that this necessarily means to make games a future career, rather it is about pointing them towards the general applicability of their interest and showing them how it may have value and meaning in a broader sense.","Althoff T., White R.W., Horvitz E., Influence of Pokémon Go on Physical Activity: Study and Implications, Journal of Medical Internet research, 18, 12, (2016); Anderson J., Barnett M., Using Video Games to Support Pre-Service Elementary Teachers Learning of Basic Physics Principles, Journal of Science Education and Technology, 20, pp. 347-362, (2011); Bediou B., Adams D.M., Mayer R.E., Tipton E., Green C.S., Meta-Analysis of Action Video Game Impact on Perceptual, Attentional, and Cognitive Skills, Psychological Bulletin, 144, 1, pp. 77-110, (2018); Blair L., What Video Games Can Teach Us about Badges and Pathways, Digital Badges in Muilenburg and Berge (eds.)

The process of gamification has been found to improve engagement levels, motivate participation and improve outcomes of activities. The primary focus of Gamification research has been on understanding how it can improve the process of learning, especially in academics or education. The impact of gamification in the organizational context is still relatively unexplored. The current study attempts to provide evidence supporting the use of gamification in organizational training. The study adopted an experimental methodology and is set in the context of organizations in India. The findings suggest that potential learners responded more positively to the gamified module and the knowledge gained was also higher through the gamified module. The gamified module also resulted in higher learner motivation. Thus, the current study provide support for the Theory of Gamified Learning that proposes that Gamification would increase Learner Motivation and thereby improve Learner reaction to the training and increase Learning. © 2021, Association for Educational Communications & Technology.",Gamification; Learner motivation; Learning; Reaction; Training,,,,,,,,"Andriamiarisoa R., Impact of gamification on student engagement in graduate medical studies, (2018); Armstrong M.B., An evaluation of game fiction-enhanced training: Using narrative to improve trainee reactions and learning, (2015); Arthur W., Tubre T., Paul D.S., Edens P.S., Teaching effectiveness: The relationship between reaction and learning evaluation criteria, Educational Psychology, 23, 3, pp. 275-285, (2003); Braver M.W., Braver S.L., Statistical treatment of the Solomon four-group design: A meta-analytic approach, Psychological Bulletin, 104, 1, (1988); Brown K.G., An examination of the structure and nomological network of trainee reactions: A closer look at"" smile sheets, Journal of Applied Psychology, 90, 5, (2005); Deci E.L., Ryan R.M., Self-determination theory: When mind mediates behavior, The Journal of Mind and Behavior, pp. 33-43, (1980); Deterding S., Dixon D., Khaled R., Nacke L., From Game Design Elements to Gamefulness: Defining, pp. 9-15, (2011); Flannelly K.J., Flannelly L.T., Jankowski K.R., Threats to the internal validity of experimental and quasi-experimental research in healthcare, Journal of Health Care Chaplaincy, 24, 3, pp. 107-130, (2018); Garris R., Ahlers R., Driskell J.E., Games, motivation, and learning: A research and practice model, Simulation & Gaming, (2002); Hamari J., Koivisto J., Sarsa H., Does Gamification Work?

For this, the teacher must use innovative strategies such as gamification together with technology as a support instrument in the teaching-learning process. The research was carried out at La Providencia School, with 30 students of sixth EGB (General Basic Education) grade with the objective of determining the contribution that this tool provides in teaching mathematics. Experimental research was applied with a quantitative approach through the application of structured questionnaires validated by Cronbach's alpha statistic, in addition to the application of the Technological Acceptance Model (TAM) to verify the user's acceptance or rejection of new technology. The validation of the hypothesis was carried out using the Friedman Chi-square statistic applied to the 4 most relevant questions to determine which hypothesis to accept and finally to check with the Kolmogorov Smirnov (KS) statistic. The results were favorable in the investigation since it can be evidenced that the students accepted these teaching resources, in this way it is concluded that Nearpod as a gamification tool improves the teaching of mathematics, promoting participation collaborative work, and inclusion; allowing the teacher to develop a different class where the student has active participation.

When applied in education, it is an approach to motivate and engage students in their learning process by incorporating game design principles. This paper presents the design and deployment of a game conducted in parallel with two groups of the engineering course “operations research”. The game design is theoretically supported, and unlike literature, the game proposed has the main distinguishing features: (a) it is carried out in parallel with the standard course, where player participation is optional, with extrinsic motivators regarding the final grade, (b) it lasts the entire semester, and it was applied to different groups with the same instructor, (c) in addition to academic performance, it has other social relatedness desired outcomes, (d) it combines the use of specific game elements divided in three types of activities: Mastery, related to the core topics of the class, Institutional, related to the university life and community, and Teamwork activities; and (e) it uses a WhatsApp chat group as the common communication platform. The assessment is twofold: the effects on learning, measured in two indicators, failure rate and average grade; and the perception of the game itself. Statistical results present empirical evidence of the positive effects of gamification on academic performance and other desired behaviors of social relatedness, such as a sense of belonging and teamwork. © 2020 The Author",Desired actions; Education; Engineering courses; Gamification in education; Higher education; Motivation; Operation research,,,,,,Universidad de Monterrey,Author thanks Universidad de Monterrey for its support to publish this paper.,"Baron R.M., Kenny D.A., The moderator-mediator variable distinction in social psychological research.

Students learn best when they are actively involved in the learning process. The concept of gamification is an emerging alternative approach that adds game elements to traditional instruction, engaging students in learning engineering concepts. In recent years, capture-the-flag competitions is a gamification approach to train and build students' interest in cybersecurity. During the Spring 2020 academic term, a team of students from the Electrical and Computer Engineering department of Morgan State University participated in an embedded capture-the-flag (eCTF) organized by MITRE. The eCTF was also offered as a graduate course. This graduate course included a cohort of minority students who had been exposed to fundamental concepts regarding secure embedded systems. We found that the eCTF allowed students to work in teams, develop critical thinking skills, address complex technical issues associated with real-world applications, and motivate continued learning, and increased research productivity after the course ended. This paper aims to describe the design and implementation of the eCTF competition in the graduate course and summarize the successes as well as the barriers that impact the engagement of minority students in cybersecurity. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021",Capture-the-flag(ctf); Embedded systems; Engineering education,Curricula; Cybersecurity; Embedded systems; Students; African American; Capture the flag; Cyber security; Embedded-system; Gamification; Graduate course; Minority student; New approaches; Student learning; Underrepresented students; Engineering education,,,,,"International Business Machines Corporation, IBM; General Motors of Canada","Kevin T.

The proposal is carried out with two groups of 6th grade from primary education, with a total of 54 students. It is a descriptive research with a qualitative orientation, that combines a questionnaire, an observation diary and rate rubrics. The analysis shows a slight improvement in the English language expression and an important improvement in students' attention, which increases positively the motivation and participation among them. © 2021 GTE-Educational Technology Group, University of the Balearic Islands.

A gamified environment transfers motivational elements of games to learning activities thereby engaging learners in the learning task thus transforming dull classroom environments to smart ones. This paper presents the design process of a gamification intervention in geometry at elementary level, based upon Huang and Soman (Gamification of education. Research report series: behavioural economics in action, 29. Rothman School of Management, University of Toronto, Toronto, 2013) model. We describe how insights from various sources helped us to refine an intervention previously used in one school. The design focuses on gamifying the tangram, an unplugged resource, through incorporating game-based elements of leader boards, points/stars and challenge levels to motivate young learners individually and in teams. Cognitive and motivational scaffolding undergird five challenge levels to bring affordances to self and social elements for learner participation in increasingly complex geometry tasks. There are limited theoretical models to guide educational researchers, especially ones that do not require digital resources.

It provides, at systemic level, the modernization and activation of educational paths through cooperation with partners from different countries through participatory approaches based on ICT. The aim of PUDCAD is the creation of a playful computer assisted drawing application that allows interior architecture and design students to learn and use Universal design principles. This paper explains the different stages of research implementation. The first step was a workshop focused on a survey method developed to verify the compliance of educational environments with the principles of Universal Design (Checklist). Together with simulated direct experience (Empathy trial), it led the students involved to the creation of scenarios for school integration. In the second workshop the application of ad hoc parameter of universal design for spaces of learning led to the definition of Game Maps, where environments and characters of the game were identified. In the third, building on the second step material, table games able of sensitizing the user and supporting her/him in the design of inclusive environments were developed. In the fourth workshop the students developed and tested the videogame’s Alpha version providing feedback and ideas for the ultimate version presented in the fifth workshop. Reviewing the process applied to build the application, the article explores educational experimentation and pedagogical aspects, emphasizing how the videogame, beyond entertainment, can support and promote new learning paths complementary to canonical teaching methods. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Design education; Ergonomics; Gamification; Inclusion; Participation; Universal design,,,,,,"Architecture Department; Association for Well-being of Children with Cerebral Palsy; Bahcesehir University of Istanbul; Department of Design; Detmolder School of Architecture and Interior Architecture; Institute of Design and Fine Arts; Istanbul Technical University, Faculty of Architecture; Occupational Therapy Association of Turkey; SERÇEV; Technische Hochschule Ostwestfalen-Lippe; Università degli Studi di Firenze, UniFI; Politecnico di Milano; Laurea University of Applied Sciences","Authors of this paper wish to thank Istanbul Technical University, Faculty of Architecture team that led the project and all the participants from Bahcesehir University of Istanbul; Lahti University of Applied Sciences, Institute of Design and Fine Arts; Università degli Studi di Firenze, Architecture Department; Technische Hochschule Ostwestfalen-Lippe, Detmolder School of Architecture and Interior Architecture; Politecnico di Milano, Department of Design; SERÇEV, Association for Well-being of Children with Cerebral Palsy; Occupational Therapy Association of Turkey.","Mace R.L., Hardie G.J., Place JP (1996) Accessible environments: Toward universal design, AUED 9(96), (1996); Buratti G., Amoruso G., Costa F., Pillan M., Rossi M., Cordan O., Arslan Dincay D., PUDCAD project.

However, gamified reading is new, and there is little empirical evidence regarding its effectiveness. The sustainability of the effects of gamification pedagogy is also in doubt as some scholars think that such effects are short-term and not sustainable. This paper presents the results of three sub-studies of examining the effects of an online gamified reading platform and the sustainability of these effects. Study 1 examined the change in students’ academic performance between two groups divided based on their different participation levels. Study 2 addressed the question of how students/parents/teachers perceive students’ motivation and gaining in the use of the gamified platform. Study 3 explored the sustainability of the effects of the gamified platform from a longitudinal perspective. Findings suggest that students’ deep engagement in the gamified e-learning platform can help increase their reading motivation and improve their reading abilities. Such effects can be sustained for several semesters. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic Reading is very important for children’s development. However, the ubiquity of digital entertainment (eg, digital games & online videos) occupies children’s attention and energy, resulting in a decline in children’s reading motivation. At present, gamification has been widely used in e-learning to increase learners’ learning motivation and engagement. Few studies have focused on children’s gamified reading supported by sufficient empirical evidence. What this paper adds This study proposes a gamification pedagogy with a gamified reading platform to facilitate primary students’ reading motivation and competence. This study uses a mixed-method approach to examine the effects of the proposed gamification pedagogy on students’ reading interest, motivation, habits and abilities. This study explores the sustainability of the gamified platform effects and fills the research gap regarding the sustainability of gamification pedagogy. Implications for practice and/or policy Active users of the gamified reading platform benefit from it in reading interest, motivation, habits, and abilities. The effects of gamification pedagogy can be sustainable when users’ intrinsic learning motivation is aroused. © 2020 British Educational Research Association",children’s reading; gamification; gamified learning;

We use a quantitative methodological approach with a quasi-experimental design and surveys as assessment tools. All 62 participants were studying Musical Education and its Didactics in their Bachelor’s Degree in Primary Education at a private Spanish university and had finished their internship period. Application of the gamification strategy proved effective for dynamic teaching-learning. Findings show how the appropriate teacher training in didactic use of information and communication technologies (ICT) can achieve positive educational results when used correctly.

In the case of the accounting profession, it is usual to face legislation, documentation, reports, ratios, databases, etc. in other languages. Our students must be familiar with the different environments that allow them to consult any type of information, such as balance sheets, income statements, among other national and international companies. Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have provided an opportunity as a means of innovation and motivation in university education. Specifically, gamification in learning contributes to improving attention, concentration, complex thinking, strategic planning or problem solving. An example of this is the use of Kahoot. This work gathers the experience of applying gamification in the classroom to students from different backgrounds, to improve teaching-learning, specifically focusing on the use of kahoot as a learning tool in accounting for national and international students. The objective that we set ourselves is, first of all, to characterize the students who participate in different accounting classes at the University of Barcelona, ​​and if there are significant differences in participation in the accounting subject between national and international students and, on the other hand, to identify if there are differences by origin of country and gender, and finally show whether the use of kahoot produces a difference in the learning outcomes between students of different origins and gender. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Gamification accounting; Internationalization; Teaching learning,,,,,,,,"Brehm J.W., Self E.A., The intensity of motivation, Annu.

Such success, confirmed by the extensive researching work carried out throughout the last decade, is based on two principles: the culture of participation and the principle of intercreativity. Not surprisingly, gamification applied to education contexts is developing as an essential tool to train citizens of the post-digital era. In this sense, it has become clear that the ideal format and displays to carry out gamification actions are mobile devices, closely linked to the principle of ubiquity according to which, citizens of the twenty-first century may learn where and when they wish, independently of the analogical concepts of time and space. This chapter explains the theoretical and practical grounds for the gamification strategies used at ECO European Project. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.",Classic Game Theory; Culture of participation; Engagement; Gamification; Gamification strategies; Intercreativity; MOOCs; Motivation; Post-digital era; Serious games; Social media,,,,,,,,"Altinpulluk H., Kesim M., The evolution of MOOCs and a clarification of terminology through literature review, Re-Imaging Learning Environments Proceedings of the European Distance and E-Learning Network.

However, attending to every student should still be a must for all educators. This case study examines the effect of a gamified proposal on third and fourth level primary students. The study uses a mixed methods approach analyzing quantitatively students' participation data (n=138) and qualitatively the viewpoint of the involved teacher through an interview. The quantitative results show statistically significant differences in the students' participation during the weeks that gamification was applied. Moreover, the interview displays four categories that conform the teachers' perspective regarding the intervention: inclusion, participation, motivation and personal challenge. In conclusion, the study discloses that gamification may be a useful method to promote an inclusive education, increase students' participation as well as their motivation. In addition, it contributes to share relevant information transferable to other contexts in order to improve distance education experiences guaranteeing attention to all students. © 2021 Universidad de Murcia.

The lack of self-motivation and intermittent engagement is one of the prime challenges faced by educators today. Perplexing tasks for the faculty are to embroil students during the lecture. This work paves new ways to scale up the enticement using artificial intelligence and machine learning. The intelligent framework proposed here is built on yet another novel methodology used globally for user engagement and is termed gamification. The primary objective of the present research work is to negate the issue of disengagement by designing and implementing a gamified framework on 120 students from higher education that will include student engagement, enticement, and motivation. Generally, mechanisms are designed for specific courses, whereas the gamified system proposed is an open-ended method irrespective of course and the program being studied, and this framework has endeavored on multiple courses. To enhance the utility of the gamified framework, ANFIS model is utilized for smart decision-making concerning rewards distribution that is directly proportional to the number of coins gained by the students. As an outcome, better participation of a group of students under the proposed intelligent gamified system is reported as compared to the control group thus endorsing the success of the model.  © 2021 Kavisha Duggal et al.",,Decision making;

This work provides a systematic review which identifies the main findings reported in the scientific literature on the perception of the university student towards the practice of gamification strategies in their learning process. The documentary search carried out was based on the triangulation of the publications included in the ""Web of Science"" and ""Scopus"" databases during the period 2010-2019. After applying the selection and quality criteria, a total of 20 studies have been identified as the final sample. The results demonstrate the growing interest of the scientific community to propose works on gamification in Higher Education. Furthermore, a favorable predisposition of the students towards the development of innovative didactic experiences based on gamification is corroborated. Among its potential, the increase in motivation, interest and participation of students in the teaching-learning process stands out, along with the improvement of their academic performance and the development of the skills and competences necessary for their professional development. © 2021 Asociacion Interuniversitaria de Investigacion en Pedagogia.

The Cosmic Ray Extremely Distributed Observatory (CREDO) experiment is designed for the large-scale study of various radiation forms that contin-uously reach the Earth from space, collectively known as cosmic rays. The CREDO Detector app relies on a network of involved users and is now working worldwide across phones and other CMOS sensor-equipped devices. To broaden the user base and activate current users, CREDO extensively uses the gamification solutions like the periodical Particle Hunters Competition. However, the adverse effect of gamification is that the number of artefacts, i.e., signals unrelated to cosmic ray detection or openly related to cheating, substantially increases. To tag the artefacts appearing in the CREDO database we propose the method based on machine learning. The approach involves training the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognise the morphological difference between signals and artefacts. As a result we obtain the CNN-based trigger which is able to mimic the signal vs. artefact assignments of human annotators as closely as possible. To enhance the method, the input image signal is adaptively thresholded and then transformed using Daubechies wavelets. In this exploratory study, we use wavelet transforms to amplify distinctive image features. As a result, we obtain a very good recognition ratio of almost 99% for both signal and artefacts. The proposed solution allows eliminating the manual supervision of the competition process. © 2021 by the authors.

As other basic engineering subjects, it needs an active participation of the students in the learning process. However, nowadays, one of the main difficult to teach this kind of disciplines is to keep the student's motivation and participation in the learning process. For this reason, the use of new tools, as the educational gamification, can help to change the way to understand and teach this subject (Ballesteros et al., 2019). In this context, the application of game-based activities to engineering education has increased in popularity among students (Blumenfeld et al., 1991). In this work, we present the application of a escape room-based to heat transfer interactive evaluation for third year chemical engineering students. The plot of our escape lab-room is focused on a crazy scientific (Dr. Nusselito Graetzoff) that is obsessed with the heat transfer. He has retained a group of scientists and has the code for a missile launch. It is a national security case! The students (distributed by groups) play the role of heat transfer specialists from different Research Centers, which have to complete two missions: release the imprisoned scientists, and avoid the missile launch planned by Dr. Nusselito. Therefore, the students have to solve different questions/cases related to heat transfer issues, obtaining the codes that will allow them to complete their mission. The plot of the activity is conducted by using videos, in which the different parts of the activity are described. In addition, the professors supervise and help the correct progress of the escape room. We used the same kind of theoretical and applied problems in both evaluation methods, traditional exam and escape room one. After this experience, we can confirm the increase of student participation regarding to previous years. In addition, the students showed enthusiastic attitude (Fig. 1a) and a high satisfaction level. Therefore, the students’ participation of escape lab-room, to heat transfer teaching was completely successful, although this activity only accounts for a 10 % of the total course score. © 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers",(6 maximum) escape room; Active learning; Cooperative learning; Gamification; Heat transfer; Student-centered learning,Heat transfer; Learning systems; Missile launching systems; Missiles; National security; Chemical engineering students; Engineering degrees; Evaluation methods; Learning process; Missile launches; Previous year; Research center; Student participation; Students,,,,,,,"Ballesteros M.A., Daza M.A., Valdes J.P., Ratkovich N., Reyes L.H., Applying PBL methodologies to the chemical engineering courses: unit operations and modeling and simulation, using a joint course project, Educ.

However, student feedback about gamification in nursing contexts is needed. Purpose The aim of this study was to describe nursing student perceptions of how gamification impacts student motivation and engagement. Methods A convergent mixed-methods study was conducted. Surveys were completed by 58 first-year nursing students. Survey comments and data extracted from the learning management system were also collected. Results Students generally found gamification valuable, interesting, and enjoyable. Gamification took effort and was perceived as important. Students felt that they had some choice in participation in the gamified activities. Conclusions Gamification is a viable strategy for promoting motivation and engagement among first year nursing students. More qualitative research is needed to enable game design refinement through investigation of contextualized student experiences. Refined game design may impact the development of learner skills through a moderating effect on engagement in course activities. © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

To clarify aspects such as the degree of acceptance and motivation, if the limited time generates stress and when it is more favorable to carry out them, a survey was developed in 48 second-year students of an Agricultural Engineering degree. Additionally, to assess the degree of consolidation of knowledge, 5 questions chosen randomly from 3 previous Kahoot!s relative to three thematic blocks of 2 weeks each were repeated in a review Kahoot! in week 7 (with 5 weeks, 3 weeks and 1 week, respectively, from each corresponding Kahoot!). More than 95% of the surveyed students showed high or very high satisfaction, mainly due to the increase in participation, entertainment, usefulness for understanding and reinforcement of knowledge. However, more than 25% of the students felt anxiety, with the limited time to answer constituting a possible cause of this. The effectiveness of this tool for consolidating knowledge was demonstrated, at least until 5 weeks, since the number of questions remembered by the students was greater than 20% in the three questionnaires carried out, independently of the time elapsed between the questionnaire and their review in the final questionnaire. © 2021 Kassel University Press GmbH.

However, one of the most significant issues is the lack of participation of the students in pre-class online activities. In this study, a Gamified Flipped Classroom (GFC) environment proposes a solution to this issue. A true-experimental design was used in the study and the effects of teaching in this environment on students' online behaviors and achievements were investigated. The participants were fourth-year undergraduate petroleum and natural gas engineering students enrolled in a natural gas engineering course. The experimental group students learned with the gamified flipped classroom (GFC) method, while the control group students learned with the conventional flipped classroom (CFC) method. Data were collected from a natural gas concept test (NGCT), weekly quizzes, and data logs from Moodle. The research results indicated that teaching in the gamified flipped classroom (GFC) method showed a significant increase in the students' participation in the pre-class activities of the flipped classroom compared to the control group. Moreover, there was a significant increase in the achievement levels of the experimental group as compared to the control group. The results of this study provide evidence that the use of gamification elements in the pre-class phase of the flipped classroom method not only enhanced the students' pre-course online behaviour but also significantly improved their achievement. © 2021 Kassel University Press GmbH.

Specifically, we describe a web system called Edutrivias (https://edutrivias.cl ) which allows the interaction between teacher and engineering students through game-based learning. Edutrivias allows teachers to create trivia games that can be played by students, as many times as they want, within determined goals and a period of time defined by the teacher. Every time a student plays a trivia, he/she receives information regarding his/her level of progress. At the same time, the teacher can verify the participation of the students, as well as the level of the group and individual advancement. From a pedagogical point of view, teachers deliver knowledge through the trivia games, while the students “play” trivia games to acquire, increase and apply their knowledge through an intermittent reinforcement learning program. The main goals of this article are: (1) to present the foundations of the use of game-based learning in the competence development of engineering students, (2) to describe the main components and functionalities of Edutrivias, and (3) to present the results of an exploratory case study of Edutrivias with information of Chilean students of an engineering school at the University of Talca. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Game-based learning in engineering; Gamification in engineering careers,Engineering education; HTTP; Reinforcement learning; Students; Competence development; Engineering schools; Exploratory case studies; Game-Based; Game-based Learning; Teaching-learning process; University context; Web support; Learning systems,,,,,,,"Fleer M., Technologically constructed childhoods: Moving beyond a reproductive to a productive and critical view of curriculum development, Australas.

Firstly, the high dropout rate and the lack of learners' motivation are significant issues in MOOCs, which cast doubt on the quality of teaching and learning. Secondly, MOOC users' diversity creates problems and barriers to MOOC providers in designing successful and effective courses that will suit all types of users. It is still unclear to think about how to reach various types of MOOC participants. In this regard, gamification is proposed as a complement to existing learning approaches to provide learners with a powerful and motivational learning experience. For decreasing the high dropout rates in MOOCs and to engage the learners and improve their motivation by adopting gamification in education, this study aims to classify gamification into three categories: achievement, social, and immersion (ASI). Furthermore, 27 gaming elements are identified that have been used in a MOOC context and are mapped to the aforementioned categories in order to help the MOOC developers and designers better understand how the various gamification categories can influence the users.  © 2020 IEEE.",dropout; gamification categories; gaming elements; MOOC; motivation,Distance education; Motivation; Teaching; Educational institutions; Learning approach; Learning experiences; Massive open online course; Quality of teaching; Three categories; Gamification,,,,,,,"Wu B., Chen X., Continuance intention to use MOOCs: Integrating the technology acceptance model (TAM) and task technology fit (TTF) model, Computers in Human Behavior, 67, pp. 221-232, (2017); Jung Y., Lee J., Learning engagement and persistence in massive open online courses (MOOCS), Computers & Education, 122, pp. 9-22, (2018); Morales M., Amado-Salvatierra H., Hernandez R., Pirker R., Giitl C., A practical experience on the use of gamification in MOOC courses as a strategy to increase motivation, Proceedings of International Workshop on Learning Technology for Education Challenges, pp. 139-149, (2016); Bakar N., Yusof A.F.A., Ihad F., Ahmad A.N.N., The implementation of gamification in massive open online courses (MOOC) platform, Proceedings of International Conference on User Science and Engineering, pp. 183-193, (2018); Aparicio M., Oliveira T., Bacao F., Painho M., Gamification: A key determinant of massive open online course (MOOC) success, Information & Management, 56, 1, pp. 39-54, (2019); Giitl C., Rizzardini R.H., Chang V., Morales M., Attrition in MOOC: Lessons learned from drop-out student, Proceedings International Workshop on Learning Technology for Education in Cloud, pp. 37-48, (2014); Deterding S., Dixon D., Khaled R., Nacke L., From game design elements to gamefulness: Defining"" gamification, Proceedings of the 15th International Academic MindTrek Conference: Envisioning Future Media Environments, pp. 9-15, (2011); Xi N., Hamari J., Does gamification satisfy needs?

In this online course, the areas of competence and the teaching method adopted draw from the precepts of visual literacy. Gamification is the approach adopted to encourage student participation in and engagement with the learning process. The findings corroborate the effectiveness and replicability of this educational toolkit and identify online library services as essential partners. The collaboration of such services is ideal for implementing the proposal for online university training. One line of action suggested in this regard is to use academic skills centers (ASC) to link library resources to non-formal digital skills training in pursuit of academic excellence. © 2021 The Author(s).

Education has changed from face-to-face education to distance education. In distance education, it is the most basic duty of teachers to increase students’ participation in the lesson, motivate their learning and increase their motivation. Gamification, which is one of the new learning approaches that has come to the fore in the education process, can be used for active learning activities in this model. This study was aimed to determine university students’ views on gamified gamification activities were used in the teaching process. In this study, the qualitative research method was used. The study group of the research consists of 30 second-grade students studying at North Cyprus and some Russian Universities, in the Faculty of Education, Department of Preschool Education. The application was carried out within the scope of the computer I course in the 2020–2021 fall semester. The interview form developed by the researchers was used as a data collection tool within the scope of the research. In preparing the interview questions, the final form of the questions was given by taking the opinions of four experts. Content analysis was used in the study of the findings and results section. © 2021.

Researchers and practitioners have been and are oriented towards game-based learning (GBL). Recently, their interest also included gamification, defined as integration of the game elements and strategies in learning activities. This study investigates the opinions of primary school teachers on fun and educational digital games. The survey was conducted using a questionnaire adapted by researchers from the literature and applied online. Participation was voluntary. The results show that most respondents use the digital games in the classroom for the development of new knowledge and mainly as a learning method/strategy and not as a learning framework. Respondents: The lack of interest in didactic digital games has its source in the absence of good practices and training in this field and poor curricular stipulations that can encourage GBL and gamification of learning. © Bucharest University Press.",didactic games; digital games; game based learning; gamification; primary school,,,,,,,,"Buckleyand P., Doyle E., Gamification and Student Motivation, Interactive Learning Environments, 24, 6, pp. 1162-1175, (2016); Chateau J., Copilul și jocul, (1972); Dumitru I.R., Rolul jocului didactic în dezvoltarea creativității copiilor din clasele primare, (2016); Erenli K., The Impact of Gamification.

The online distance learning necessitated by the Covid19-pandemic has further intensified this challenge. In order to encourage the desired activity on the part of the students and to build up a sense of belonging, a gamification approach was tried out in a large computer science introductory module with about 550 participants. This involved collecting so-called ""Algos""together by all course participants through various activities, with advantages granted to all students for reaching a certain amount of Algos together. In combination with humorous elements and contexts (e.g. ""Easter eggs""and word problems), the gamification system led to a high level of satisfaction among the students. Although the majority of the students did not perceive the Algos as the main motivation for most of the concrete activities, the lecturers were also satisfied with the actual participation in the digital semester.  © 2021 ACM.",Cooperative; CS1; Easter eggs; Gamification; Word problem,Behavioral research; Distance education; Education computing; Co-operative behaviors; Cooperative; Easter egg; First year students; Gamification; Large computers; Level of satisfaction; Online distance learning; Sense of belonging; Word problem; Students,,,,,,,"Images of Gilf and Trixi; Deterding S., Dixon D., Khaled R., Nacke L., From Game Design Elements to Gamefulness: Defning ""Gamifcation"" (MindTrek '11), pp. 9-15, (2011); Dicheva D., Irwin K., Dichev C., OneUp: Engaging Students in a Gamifed Data Structures Course, Proceedings of the 50th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education (Minneapolis, MN, USA) (SIGCSE '19), pp. 386-392, (2019); Hamari J., Koivisto J., Social motivations to use gamifcation: An empirical study of gamifying exercise, ECIS 2013-Proceedings of the 21st European Conference on Information Systems, (2013); Latulipe C., Long N.B., Seminario C.E., Structuring Flipped Classes with Lightweight Teams and Gamifcation, Proceedings of the 46th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education (Kansas City, Missouri, USA) (SIGCSE '15), pp. 392-397, (2015); Pintrich P., A Motivational Science Perspective on the Role of Student Motivation in Learning and Teaching Contexts, Journal of Educational Psychology, 95, pp. 667-686, (2003); Sprint G., Fox E., Improving Student Study Choices in CS1 with Gamifcation and Flipped Classrooms (SIGCSE '20), pp. 773-779, (2020); Weyers S., Inverted Classroom meets Gamifcation-Einsatz eines Bonuspunktesystems in einer Grundlagenveranstaltung, Inverted Classroom Vielfältiges Lernen Begleitband zur, 7, pp. 245-249, (2018)",,Stikkolorum D.; Rahimi E.,Association for Computing Machinery,,"10th Computer Science Education Research Conference, CSERC 2021",22 November 2021 through 23 November 2021,"Virtual, Online",178757,,978-145038576-3,,,English,ACM Int.

This can contribute to increasing participation, motivation, enjoyment, academic performance, and the transfer of knowledge to learners. Higher education has a substantial role in motivating students by applying this concept to educational goals. This study investigates the gamification concepts as an educational resource, a motivation strategy, a solution to improve the professional knowledge and skills, a novel method for organizing teaching-learning, a platform, an innovative method in the learning processes, a learning scenario, an assessment tool, a pedagogical/didactic approach, and an application to higher education studies. Furthermore, this paper explores gamification reviews in education. Then the teaching-learning approaches which are used in the higher education context are identified. At the first step, a scoping review is carried out through 56 articles. At the second step, various learning approaches and strategies are highlighted. © 2021 IEEE",Gamification; Higher Education; Learning Approach; Learning Strategy; scoping review,Knowledge management; Motivation; Academic performance; Educational goals; Gamification; High educations; Learning approach; Learning strategy; Scoping review; Teaching and learning; Teaching-learning; Transfer of knowledge; Learning systems,,,,,,,"Gomez-Bayona L., Moreno-Lopez G., Machuca-Villegas L., La gamificación en mercadeo educativo como estrategia de gestión en las universidades acreditadas, Revista Ibérica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informação, 34, pp. 336-349; Durao N., Et al., A comparative study about mobile learning with gamification and augmented reality in high education instituitions across South Europe, South America, and Asia countries; Pal'ova D., Vejacka M., Gamification tools improving university students' involvement in the education process; Bawa P., Game On!: Investigating Digital Game-Based Versus Gamified Learning in Higher Education, International Journal of Game-Based Learning (IJGBL), 10, 3, pp. 16-46, (2020); Gilyazova O.S., Zamoshchanskii I.I., On motivational tools of gamification in higher education: theoretical aspect, (2020); Tuparova D., Tuparov G., Orozova D., Educational computer games and Gamification at the higher education-students' points of view; Subhash S., Cudney E.A., Gamified learning in higher education: A systematic review of the literature, Computers in Human Behavior, 87, pp. 192-206, (2018); Grosseck G., Malita L., Sacha G.M., GAMIFICATION IN HIGHER EDUCATION: A BIBLIOMETRIC APPROACH, eLearning & Software for Education, (2020); Costa F.A., Viana J., Raleiras M., What Do Higher Education Students Have to Say About Gamification?; Aguiar-Castillo L., Et al., Gamification and deep learning approaches in higher education, Journal of Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism Education, (2020); Limantara N., Hidayanto A.N., Prabowo H., The elements of gamification learning in higher education: A systematic literature review, International Journal of Mechanical Engineering and Technology, 10, 2, pp. 982-991, (2019); Paragulla J.V., Andrade-Arenas L., Barriales A.L.F., Gamification in university teaching for Systems Engineering students at a Lima North University; Ferriz-Valero A., Et al., Gamification in physical education: Evaluation of impact on motivation and academic performance within higher education, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, 17, 12, (2020); Stott A., Neustaedter C., Analysis of gamification in education, 8, (2013); Caponetto I., Earp J., Ott M., Gamification and education: A literature review; van der Poll A.E., van Zyl I.J., Kroeze J.H., A Systematic Literature Review of Qualitative Gamification Studies in Higher Education; Ahmad A., Et al., Does one size fit all?

Several resources were applied within the classroom online for one semester as an alternative to traditional strategies in online education. Education has taken an abysmal turn as a result of the pandemic throughout this year, so that teachers and students had to adapt to new educational models, the educational model was the application of flipped classroom, also use of synchronous and asynchronous tools, and use of digital grading rubrics, video conferences Tools, and multimedia materials developed by teachers, among others. The authors applied ADDIE methodology to develop these tools which propose the generation of more effective resources in educational innovation. The statistic that was applied to test the hypothesis was Wilcoxon due to the fact it was an experimental-exploratory research. Finally, the results of this research allowed to identify the difference in the academic performance of the students when using resources based on gamification developed by the Professors, these results show that there is better attention to online classes when direct gamification tools are used. Thus, teachers promote better participation active when they use synchronous tools within online classes and not just common everyday tools. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Gamification; Higher education; ICT; Learning; Serious games,E-learning; Education computing; Grading; Learning systems; Multimedia systems; Students; Educational modelling; Gamification; High educations; ICT; Learning; Learning strategy; Online class; Teachers'; University students; Virtual class; Serious games,,,,,"Research in Language and Education and Marketing Consumption and Society; Universidad Técnica de Ambato, UTA","Thanks to the Technical University of Ambato, to the Directorate of Research and Development (DIDE acronym in Spanish) for supporting our research project Development of Web 3.0 Tools in education as support in collaborative learning and being part of the research groups: Research in Language and Education and Marketing Consumption and Society.","Gentina E., Chen R., Digital natives’ coping with loneliness: Facebook or face-to-face?, Inf.

The Tecquium program fights back the declining interest in STEM areas in teenagers and young adults. It employs novel education techniques as flipped classroom, gamification and problem-based learning during the participation of a Mexican team in an international programming and 1/10 autonomous vehicles racing competition. These techniques belong to the Tec21 model. There are two focus groups: high school and undergraduate. Each one of them aims to develop specific technical and social skills. The continuous development of knowledge in AGVs demand a state-of-the-art platform capable of running high demanding calculations and movement. Sensing, sensor fusion, data processing, ML, AI and path planning algorithms form the basis of the program's curriculum. More than twenty students have been reached. Results show the effectivity of this program as there is a bigger interest in participating in STEM related activities in high schoolers and a higher commitment in undergraduate students doing research. © 2020 IEEE.",AGV; AI; autonomy; higher education; innovation education; leadership; mobility; PBL; STEM; Tec21,"Autonomous vehicles; Data handling; Education computing; Ground vehicles; Motion planning; Sensor data fusion; Students; Autonomous ground vehicles; Continuous development; Education programs; Education technique; Path-planning algorithm; Problem based learning; State of the art; Undergraduate students; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics)",,,,,,,"Anelli M., Shih K., Williams K., Foreign Peer Effects and Stem Major Choice, (2017); Moakler M., Kim M., College major choice in stem: Revisiting confidence and demographic factors, The Career Development Quarterly., 62, (2014); Beier M., Rittmayer A., Literature Overview: Motivational Factors in STEM: Interest and Self-concept; Westrick P., Radunzel J., Bassiri D., Leaning into STEM: Predicting STEM Major Choice Using Measures of Academic Tilt and Measured Interest Tilt, (2018); Montserrat S.R., Furio C., Desinterés del alumnado hacia el aprendizaje de la ciencia: implicaciones en su enseñanza, Dialnet, (2019); Henshaw R., Desirable attributes for professional engineers, Broadening Horizons of Engineering Education,3rd Annual Conference of Australasian Association for Engineering Education, pp. 199-204, (1991); Lang J.D., Cruise S., McVey F.D., McMasters J., Industry expectations of new engineers: A survey to assist curriculum designers, Journal of Engineering Education, 88, 1, pp. 43-51, (1999); Mills J., Treagust D., Engineering education-is problem-based or project-based learning the answer?, Australian Journal of Engineering Education, (2003); Ceker E., Ozdamli F., Features and characteristics of problem based learning, Educational Sciences, 11, 4, pp. 195-202, (2016); Ferreira M.M., Trudel A.R., The impact of problem-based learning (pbl) on student attitudes toward science, problem-solving skills, and sense of community in the classroom, The Journal of Classroom Interaction, 47, 1, pp. 23-30, (2012); Duch B., Groh S., Allen D., The Power of Problem-Based Learning, pp. 5-7, (2001); Montoro L., Evaluación continua y autogestión del aprendizaje: una visión interdisciplinar, UNIVEST, (2019); Bautista-Montesano R., Gomez-Aladro V., Lopez-Valdes E., Jimenez-Rios D., Mit beaver works summer institute as a research and innovation experience through project-based learning, 5o Congreso Internacional de Innovación Educativa, (2018); Bautista R., Lopez E., Jimenez D., Gomez V., Autonomous vehicles and aerospace engineering as a steam development platform, Proceedings of the IEEE Integrated STEM Education Conference (ISEC), pp. 384-387, (2019); Swain R., Grasa P., Schiavon A., Tec21 educational model: Semetre i implementation, EEIC, (2016); Autores V., Tec21 Un nuevo modelo educativo para un nuevo tipo de estudiante, Milenio, (2014); Corrales M., Retos Institucionales del Modelo TEC21 para Garantizar el Desarrollo de Competencias de Egreso, Congreso Internacional de Innovación Educativa, (2019); Classroom F., Qué es flipped classroom?, Flipped Classroom, (2019); Rosell C., Flipped Classroom presente y futuro de blended learning, Innovative Learning Solutions; Chis A., Moldovan A., Murphy L., Pathak P., Muntean C., Investigating flipped classroom and problem-based learning in a programming module for computing conversion course, EBSCO, (2019); Demkah M., Bhargava D., Gamification in education: A cognitive psychology approach to cooperative and fun learning, 2019 Amity International Conference on Artificial Intelligence; Nag S., Heffan I., Saenz-Otero A., Lydon M., Spheres zero robotics software development: Lessons on crowdsourcing and collaborative competition, Aerospace Conference 2012 IEEE, pp. 1-17, (2012); MIT Beaver Works Summer Institute Brochure, (2019); Tsardoulias E., Mitkas P., Robotic Frameworks, Architectures and Middleware Comparison, (2019)",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,"2020 IEEE European Technology and Engineering Management Summit, E-TEMS 2020",5 March 2020 through 7 March 2020,Dortmund,161045,,978-172810903-9,,,English,"IEEE Eur.

CT is an essential problem-solving skill set in this modern era of digitization and technological advancements. To build students' knowledge and skills in CT while maximizing students' motivation and engagement in learning, a novel online adaptive gamified course called Computational Thinking Quest (CTQ) was introduced. The CTQ was designed and developed by a multidisciplinary team of students and faculty members. The key features of CTQ are (1) an interactive storyline with animated avatars, mini-games, and questions created using Unity three-dimensional cross-platform game engine and Blockly block-based visual programming language; (2) questions at three different levels of difficulty for effective adaptive and self-learning approach; (3) an answer and feedback to each question for increased students' confidence and enthusiasm towards learning; (4) hyperlinks to online learning resources for further reading; (5) a badge and a leaderboard to motivate active participation and encourage success; and (6) a course management system with automatic data saving capability to enable learning at own pace, anytime, anywhere. The CTQ was rolled out to some newly matriculated first-year undergraduate Engineering (ENG) and InfoComm Technology (ICT) students. A total of 54 ENG and 53 ICT students' learning performance and feedback were collated and analyzed. Statistical results from the paired Student's t-test and the Wilcoxon signed rank test consistently reveal that (1) the median of post-test marks is significantly higher than that of pre-test marks (p < 0.001); (2) the median of CT knowledge scores after taking CTQ is significantly higher than that of before CTQ (p < 0.001); and (3) the median time taken to complete the post-test is significantly lower than the pre-test (p < 0.001). Furthermore, more than 75% of ENG and ICT students, separately, stated that CTQ is an engaging or very engaging learning platform; 81% of them indicated that the educational content of CTQ is enriching or very enriching; and 83% of them commented that CTQ has motivated independent learning. The CTQ can also serve as a bridging course to narrow the heterogeneity gap among students with heterogeneous prior knowledge on computer programming languages and ease students into programming-related modules, thereby enhancing teaching and learning effectiveness.  © 2021 IEEE.",adaptive learning; computational thinking; gamification; independent learning; online education platform,Concentration (process); Curricula; E-learning; Education computing; Hypertext systems; Information management; Three dimensional computer graphics; Visual BASIC; Adaptive learning; Computational thinkings; Gamification; Independent learning; Infocomm; Innovative practices; On-line education; Online education platform; Platform for learning; Post test; Students,,,,,,,"Wing J.M., Computational thinking, Communications of the ACM, 49, 3, pp. 33-35, (2006); Mohaghegh M., McCauley M., Computational thinking: The skill set of the 21st century, International Journal of Computer Science and Information Technologies, 7, 3, pp. 1524-1530, (2016); Shute V.J., Sun C., Asbell-Clarke J., Demystifying computational thinking, Educational Research Review, 22, pp. 142-158, (2017); Pollock L., Mouza C., Guidry K.R., Pusecker K., Infusing computational thinking across disciplines: Reflections & lesson learned, Proc. of the 50th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education, pp. 435-441, (2019); Looi C.K., Computational thinking for every student, Infocomm Media Development Authority, (2019); Grover S., Pea R., Computational thinking: A competency whose time has come, Computer Science Education: Perspectives on Teaching and Learning in School, pp. 19-37, (2018); Hsu T.C., Chang S.C., Hung Y.T., How to learn and how to teach computational thinking: Suggestion based on a review of literature, Computers & Education, 126, pp. 296-310, (2018); Czismadia A., Curzon P., Dorling M., Humphreys S., Ng T., Selby C., Woollard J., Computational Thinking: A Guide for Teachers, (2015); Engineering Council, (2021); American Engineers' Council for Professional Development, (2021); Gross S., Kim M., Schlosser J., Mohtadi C., Lluch D., Schneider D., Fostering computational thinking in engineering education: Challenges, examples, and best practices, Proc. of the IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, pp. 450-459, (2014); Magana A.J., Coutinho G.S., Modeling and simulation practices for a computational thinking-enabled engineering workforce, Computer Applications in Engineering Education, pp. 1-17, (2016); Yadav A., Good J., Voogt J., Fisser P., Computational thinking as an emerging competence domain, Competence-Based Vocational and Professional Education, pp. 1051-1067, (2017); Tang X., Yin Y., Lin Q., Hadad R., Zhai X., Assessing computational thinking: A systematic review of empirical studies, Computers & Education, 148, (2020); Tran B., Educational experiences with traditional, online and hybrid learning environments, Journal of Education & Socal Policy, 3, 3, pp. 60-63, (2016); He S., Hang Y., Ding Y., Teaching method based on computational thinking a case research, Proc. 9th International Conference on Computer Science & Education, pp. 817-820, (2014); Gao P., Lu M., Zhao H., Li M., A new teaching pattern based on PBL and visual programming in computational thinking course, Proc. 14th International Conference on Computer Science & Education, pp. 304-308, (2019); Liao L., Liang J., An empirical study on blended learning to promote the development of computational thinking ability of college students, Proc.

This situation has forced the educational community to evolve and look for new ways to teach and learn more active, motivating and cooperative. One of the methodological strategies currently being implemented in education with positive results is gamification. It applies the mechanics of video games that attract and interest the child and youth population and moves them to formal environments such as classrooms. Specifically, this research analyzes the use of gamification as a methodological strategy focused on inclusive education, to assess its effectiveness in improving the education received by students with specific educational support needs in primary education. To this end, using a qualitative methodology, a case study was carried out in 18 Primary Education classrooms of an educational center in the Valencian Community (Spain). The results indicate that there are certain elements that facilitate the inclusion of these students in primary classrooms, such as the structuring of the learning process, the formative and continuous feedback or the personalization of the objectives. © 2021 Research Center of Universidad Pedagogica Nacional.

We hypothesize that delays in clinical presentation contribute to racial disparities in endometrial cancer mortality and treatment-related morbidity. Improved methods for endometrial cancer risk assessment and distinguishing abnormal uterine bleeding and postmenopausal bleeding from physiologic variation are needed. Accordingly, we propose a multipronged strategy that combines innovative patient education with novel early detection strategies to reduce health impacts of endometrial cancer and its precursors, especially among Black women. Futuristic approaches using gamification, smartphone apps, artificial intelligence, and health promotion outside of the physical clinic hold promise in preventing endometrial cancer and reducing morbidity and mortality related to the disease, but they also raise a number of questions that will need to be addressed by future research. © 2020 American Association for Cancer Research.",,"Disease Management; Endometrial Neoplasms; Ethnic Groups; Female; Health Education; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Postmenopause; Technology Assessment, Biomedical; Uterine Hemorrhage; tamoxifen; Article; artificial intelligence; Black person; cancer incidence; cancer mortality; cancer prevention; cancer risk; cancer screening; dilatation and curettage; drug use; early diagnosis; echography; endometrium biopsy; endometrium cancer; health care access; health care cost; health promotion; human; hysterectomy; hysteroscopy; medical technology; metrorrhagia; morbidity; ovulation; patient care; patient education; patient participation; risk assessment; risk factor; sensitivity and specificity; vagina bleeding; biomedical technology assessment; complication; disease management; endometrium tumor; ethnic group; female; health care disparity; health education; pathology; postmenopause; uterus bleeding",,"tamoxifen, 10540-29-1",,,Mayo Clinic,This study was supported in part by the Mayo Clinic Robert D. and Patricia E.

We have developed a series of five experiments based on the robust bacterial single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB) to characterize both known and unknown protein–protein and protein–DNA interactions. Students work in groups to generate and process data from electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), yeast two-hybrid, far Western, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and fluorescence microscopy experiments, including choosing a novel condition for each. A gamification approach was used to encourage student participation and laboratory safety. Student learning was assessed using pre- and post-surveys and course grade data. The results indicate a clear increase in both content knowledge and confidence in the topics presented. Ranking of course activities indicated that performing the hands-on laboratory exercises was the most valuable course component, and over half of the students would choose to take another course with a similar gamification component. Each of the five laboratory experiments can be performed in combination with each other or integrated separately into a related course, and the gamification structure can be applied to any course. © 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology",ChIP; gamification; interaction; protein-ligand; yeast two-hybrid,"Binding Sites; Blotting, Western; Chromatin Immunoprecipitation; Curriculum; DNA, Single-Stranded; DNA-Binding Proteins; Educational Measurement; Female; Humans; Male; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires; DNA binding protein; single stranded DNA; binding site; chemistry; chromatin immunoprecipitation; curriculum; education; female; fluorescence microscopy; human; isolation and purification; male; questionnaire; student; Western blotting",,"DNA, Single-Stranded, ; DNA-Binding Proteins, ",,,Course Design Institute; Edwin Antony; NC State CMIF; NC State Office of Faculty Development; Saint Louis University School of Medicine; University of Edinburgh,"We would like to thank Eva Johannes and the NC State CMIF for assistance with confocal microscopy; David Leach (University of Edinburgh) for the directed double-strand DNA break site strain; Jim Keck (University of Wisconsin-Madison) for yeast two-hybrid vectors and advice about the placement of tags in SSB; and Edwin Antony (Saint Louis University School of Medicine) for advice about teaching with SSB.

We analyse existing approaches in gamification and flipped-classroom studies for Social Sciences education, focusing our research on the different strategies (games, videogames, quizzes, investigation, etc.) that improve students' motivation. The literature shows a very high valuation of motivation in gamified and flipped-classroom implemented processes. This fact can be attributed to an increase of student participation in the construction of their own conceptual knowledge, using ITC resources and videos, the implementation of a reward evaluation system and the use of cooperative work strategies during the lessons. © Peter Lang GmbH.

Traditionally it is composed of dynamics, mechanics, and components. The purpose of this study was to compare Engineering and Economics and Social Sciences undergraduate students in their performance (grades), motivation, quality of assignments, participation, and emotion when their teachers used gamification as an innovative teaching method during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pearson correlations, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Mann–Whitney test were conducted. Additionally, four students were interviewed to describe the emotional downside of the lockdown. The main results indicate that there are higher positive relationships among variables in the Engineering undergraduate students rather than in Economics and Social Sciences and show that emotion poorly correlates with performance, especially for the Economics and Social Sciences students, as many have a negative attitude toward learning mathematics. Additionally, gender and scholarship status are not differential factors. Gamification proved to be a useful pedagogical strategy to promote participation and enhance motivation among undergraduate students, particularly in a context of academic confinement. This study gives teachers an idea of the benefits and extent to which gamification can be used in the classroom. © 2022 by the authors.

Indeed, with the rapidly growing adoption of digital tools in such courses, the use of various game elements and mechanics to drive participation is increasing. Previous studies on gamification in computing have examined the effects over the whole student population. Prior work in other disciplines has found that the benefits associated with gamification may only be realized for some students, while others may even experience reduced motivation. The Hexad user types survey attempts to tackle this problem by grouping users into six different types for whom gamification should have different effects. The goal is to personalize the game elements for different user types, thus creating gamified experiences more suitable for individual learners. In this work, we study whether the Hexad survey could be used to guide the personalization of gamification in an introductory programming course. Specifically, we examine the quality of students' answers to the Hexad survey and explore whether they can be used to predict students' preferences for enabling gamification in the platform where they complete assignments. In our specific computing education context, we find that classifying students using the Hexad survey does not appear to be an effective approach for the automatic personalization of gamification. © 2021 ACM.",gamification; hexad; personalization; programming; user types,Digital devices; Education computing; Gamification; Surveys; Computing education; Different effects; Digital tools; Effective approaches; Introductory programming course; Personalizations; Student populations; Study materials; Students,,,,,,,"Bartle R., Hearts, clubs, diamonds, spades: Players who suit MUDs, Journal of Mud Research, 1, 1, (1996); Bockle M., Novak J., Bick M., Towards adaptive gamification: A synthesis of current developments, Proc of the Twenty-Fifth European Conf on Information Systems (Guimaraes, Portugal) (ECIS '17), pp. 158-174, (2017); Chen Y., Understanding how educational gamification impacts users' behavior: A theoretical analysis, Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Information and Education Technology (Osaka, Japan) (ICIET '18), pp. 154-159, (2018); De Pontes R.G., Guerrero D.D.S., De Figueiredo J.C.A., Analyzing gamification impact on a mastery learning introductory programming course, Proceedings of the 50th Acm Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education, pp. 400-406, (2019); Denny P., The effect of virtual achievements on student engagement, Proceedings of the Sigchi Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 763-772, (2013); Denny P., Generating practice questions as a preparation strategy for introductory programming exams, Proceedings of the 46th Acm Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education, pp. 278-283, (2015); Denny P., Hamer J., Luxton-Reilly A., Purchase H., Peer wise: Students sharing their multiple choice questions, Proceedings of the Fourth International Workshop on Computing Education Research, pp. 51-58, (2008); Denny P., Luxton-Reilly A., Craig M., Petersen A., Improving complex task performance using a sequence of simple practice tasks, Proc of the 23rd Annual Acm Conf on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education, pp. 4-9, (2018); Denny P., McDonald F., Empson R., Kelly P., Petersen A., Empirical support for a causal relationship between gamification and learning outcomes, Proceedings of the 2018 Chi Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 1-13, (2018); Deterding S., Dixon D., Khaled R., Nacke L., From game design elements to gamefulness: Defining ""gamification, Proceedings of the 15th International Academic MindTrek Conference: Envisioning Future Media Environments, pp. 9-15, (2011); Dichev C., Dicheva D., Angelova G., Agre G., From gamification to gameful design and gameful experience in learning, Cybern.

Millennial students often get bored, less motivated and lose their focus in the traditional learning environment due to the lack of engagement between students, as well as the instructors/ lecturers. Therefore, Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are encouraging the use of gamification in education for the purpose of improving the intrinsic motivation as well as engagement. This paper reports the students’ perceptions towards the use of gamification during their class. This study used observation and questionnaire survey towards a group of second year and final year Quantity Surveying students in the International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM). Eighty-three students responded to the questionnaire. The results showed a positive perception toward the use of gamification in their lecture. Students require effort-demanding, challenging, sophisticated learning systems that increase competency, enhance recall memory, concentration, attentiveness, commitment, and social interaction. Findings from the study shows that gamification was found to promote the student’s engagement in terms of their participation in class, enjoyment throughout the activities as well as their motivational factor to focus in class. Limitations of the study are identified, which highlights the need for further research on the subject area. © 2021, CA and C Press AB.

Methods: Teaching of family medicine was adapted to the implementation via a video conferencing system. We added epidemic-related topics, introduced regular homework, increased the use of the virtual classroom, and introduced the use of forums. We used new methods, such as “flipped classroom”, problem-based learning with clinical vignettes and video consultations in teaching communication skills. The method of gamification worked especially well with the introduction of a quiz in teaching. Results: We asked students and teachers to assess the quality of online lessons. In the students’ opinion, the lessons went well and they liked the modern methods. They suggested there should be more discussion on clinical cases and common conditions in family medicine. They gave online teaching the same score as clinical rotation. Educators mentioned high self-motivation and innovation in changing lessons, and liked the time flexibility, but at the same time found that online teaching increased time demands. In the future, some students from remote parts could perform clinical rotations in their home environment, which would reduce the number of mentors needed in Ljubljana. Online teaching offers the opportu-nity to learn the modern skills of a family doctor (such as video consultations), motivation of students (such as gamifica-tion) and enables creation of a repository of teaching materials and participation of guests from abroad. The disadvantages are lack of personal contact with the students, and inadequate learning opportunities of clinical skills. Conclusion: With the immediate transition to online teaching, we tested new teaching methods and identified some ad-vantages and disadvantages. This experience will be important for changes in teaching in the coming years. © 2021 Slovenian Medical Journal.",General practice; Online system; Undergraduate medical education,Article; attitude to health; communication skill; coronavirus disease 2019; distance learning; e-learning; epidemic; family medicine; gamification; home environment; human; human experiment; knowledge; learning; medical education; motivation; online system; primary health care; problem based learning; teaching; undergraduate student; video consultation; videoconferencing; vignette; webinar,,,,,,,"Ruiz JG, Mintzer MJ, Leipzig RM., The impact of E-learning in medical education, Acad Med, 81, 3, pp. 207-212, (2006); Carley S, Mackway-Jones K., Developing a virtual learning course in emergency medicine for F2 doctors, Emerg Med J, 24, 8, pp. 525-528, (2007); Reeves S, Fletcher S, McLoughlin C, Yim A, Patel KD., Interprofessional online learning for primary healthcare: findings from a scoping review, BMJ Open, 7, 8, (2017); Al-Shorbaji N, Rifat A, Car J, Majeed a, Wheeler E., E learning for undergraduate health professional education.

Results indicate positive effects of game play on several key dimensions of political engagement, including voter registration, virtual political participation (following a candidate on Twitter, liking a candidate on Facebook, and watching debates), and consumption of public affairs information (including National Public Radio (NPR), non-NPR political talk radio, and online news aggregator sites). In addition, game play provided significantly greater benefits to students with the lowest rates of political knowledge and engagement at baseline. Overall, participants reported high rates of game satisfaction, with 79% of participants reporting being very to somewhat pleased if they were asked to play the game again. These results are discussed in terms of the implications for civics education, pedagogy, and political engagement among young people. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Civic engagement; gamification; political socialization; technology,,,,,,Center for Political Communication at the University of Delaware,"The creation and maintenance of the vMOBilize game platform was made possible by funding from The Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation, the Center for Political Communication at the University of Delaware, and Mr. Bob Suh.","2014 Youth Turnout and Youth Registration Rates Lowest Ever Recorded; Changes Essential in 2016, (2015); Baum M.A., Soft News and Political Knowledge: Evidence of Absence or Absence of Evidence?”, Political Communication, 20, 2, pp. 173-190, (2003); Bernstein J.L., Meizlish D.S., Becoming Congress: A Longitudinal Study of the Civic Engagement Implications of a Classroom Simulation, Simulation & Gaming, 34, 2, pp. 198-219, (2003); Blais A., What Affects Voter Turnout?”, Annual Review of Political Science, 9, pp. 111-125, (2006); Brigham T.J., An Introduction to Gamification: Adding Game Elements for Engagement, Medical Reference Services Quarterly, 34, 4, pp. 471-480, (2015); (2013); Coenen T., The Design and Evaluation of a Pervasive Engagement Game in a City Neighborhood, (2014); Dalton R., (2016); Delli Carpini M.X., Gen. com: Youth, Civic Engagement, and the New Information Environment, Political communication, 17, 4, pp. 341-349, (2000); Deterding S., Dixon D., Khaled R., Nacke L., (2011); Deterding S., O'Hara K., Sicart M., Dixon D., Nacke L., (2011); Dicheva D., Dichev C., Agre G., Angelova G., Gamification in Education: A Systematic Mapping Study, Journal of Educational Technology & Society, 18, 3, pp. 75-88, (2015); dos Santos A.C., Zambalde A.L., Veroneze R.B., Botelho G.A., de Souza Bermejo P.H., Open Innovation and Social Participation: A Case Study in Public Security in Brazil, (2015); Esser F., De Vreese C.H., Comparing Young Voters' Political Engagement in the United States and Europe, American Behavioral Scientist, 50, 9, pp. 1195-1213, (2007); Galston W.A., Civic Education and Political Participation, PS: Political Science and Politics, 37, 2, pp. 263-266, (2004); Gerber A.S., Green D.P., Shachar R., Voting May be Habit‐forming: Evidence from a Randomized Field Experiment, American Journal of Political Science, 47, 3, pp. 540-550, (2003); Gordon E., Baldwin-Philippi J., Playful Civic Learning: Enabling Reflection and Lateral Trust in Game-based Public Participation, International Journal of Communication, pp. 8759-8786, (2014); (2016); Hu S.C., Chen I.C., A Gamified Online Forum Inspiring Group Intelligence Distillation for Policy Making, (2015); Jagoda P., Gamification and Other Forms of Play, Boundary 2, 40, 2, pp. 113-144, (2013); Manganelli S., Lucidi F., Alivernini F., Adolescents' Expected Civic Participation: The Role of Civic Knowledge and Efficacy Beliefs, Journal of Adolescence, 37, 5, pp. 632-641, (2014); Moeller J., de Vreese C., Esser F., Kunz R., Pathway to Political Participation: The Influence of Online and Offline News Media on Internal Efficacy and Turnout of First-time Voters, American Behavioral Scientist, 58, 5, pp. 689-700, (2014); Moffett K.W., Rice L.L., Web 2.0 and the Political Mobilization of College Students.

However, several research studies have shown that gamification has a positive impact on engagement, learning and stimulation of students’ active and effective interaction and participation in the teaching-learning process. Through the present study, it sought to present gamification as an engagement strategy for Distance Education (DE). To achieve these objectives are presented, from an exploratory-descriptive approach of qualitative nature, the concepts that make up the phenomenon, in order to demonstrate that gamification applied in DE can provide increased engagement and interaction of students in educational activities. As a result, it was possible to present the most discussed aspects about the use of gamification in DE, highlighting the increase in engagement and motivation, development of skills and the ability to deal with difficult subjects. Moreover, it is perceived a high contribution of this instrument to the motivation and performance of students, as well as to their commitment, thus becoming a strategic and necessary differential, which will culminate in the improvement of the quality of DE, requiring further study for the training of teachers capable of dealing with this instrument, permeated by technologies and digital resources. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

The established programmatic content and evaluation processes of each subject are part of the analytical planning that teachers must conduct each semester to restructure and reformulate courses based on course pass rates. The academic evaluation identifies which activities have significantly enhanced or improved student learning and specifically have helped them achieve the expected group and individual learning objectives. In the university’s programming courses, the incorporation of games through technological platforms using mobile devices strengthens the teaching-learning process by reinforcing knowledge. In an enthusiastic and fun way participation in the platform helps strengthen previous knowledge, improves student communication, encourages socialization among peers and allows for the collective identification of solutions to problems related to class material.

Our study found that gamification using a reward-based system is a strategy that can improve the educational experience under exceptional circumstances. This article reports the results of two gamified undergraduate courses (Calculus and Development of Transversal Competencies) designed with a reward system. The results derived from analyses of online surveys, the final grades, and their correlations revealed that gamification helped motivate students to participate actively and improved their academic performance, in a setting where the mode of instruction was remote, synchronous, and online. From the results we conclude that gamification favours the relationship between attention, participation, and performance, while promoting the humanisation of virtual environments created during academic confinement. Implications for practice or policy: · Gamification using a reward-based system promoted active class participation and improved student performance after the transition from face-to-face to virtual instruction required as a result of the global pandemic.

Earthquakes occur frequently in Japan, so earthquake education is essential for foreigners who live in or intend to visit Japan. However, the earthquake education is neither compulsory for foreigners, nor is it engaging somewhat. To make the earthquake education more attractive, gamification is employed. An ICT-based system, including gamification thinking, is developed to improve foreigners' participation in the earthquake education.

The model of education by competencies is no stranger to this pedagogy, which today relies on teacher creativity and student participation. The objective of this research was to analyze how gamification affects the increase in the mastery of information skills in university students. The research approach used is mixed. In the quantitative phase with a quasi-experimental design, the ALFIN-Humass questionnaire was used to measure the perception of competence development (pre and post), showing that there are significant differences between the pretest and post-test of the experimental group in the perception of ALFIN development (t = -4.63; p <.01). In the qualitative one, a focus group was conducted whose results confirmed the quantitative findings. The contribution of this work lies in pointing out the relevance of gamification as a didactic strategy in the development of Information Literacy Competency. © 2021 Universidad de Antioquia.

This study consisted of 56 college students majoring in physical education and recreation management (32 men, 24 women, age M = 21 years, SD = 1.72). Students used the educational computer game “PaGamO” to study the motor learning and development course. Students received rewards based on their individual and group “PaGamO” scores. Regression analysis indicated that “PaGamO” score was a significant (p < 0.01) predictor of multiple choice (MC) score in the final examination, there was a medium positive correlation (β = 0.354). The R2 suggests that 12.6% of MC score was explained by “PaGamO” score. Quantitative and qualitative mixed-method approach was used to gain insights into students’ perceptions and experiences of the educational game. The top three statements of a modified questionnaire from Riemer and Schrader (2015) are: (1) “In my opinion, the use of ‘PaGamO’ enables me to better prepare for the final examination” (M = 5.04, SD = 1.41), (2) “In my opinion, the use of ‘PaGamO’ enables me to understand learning contents” (M = 4.8, SD = 1.19), (3) “In my opinion, the use of ‘PaGamO’ allows me to apply knowledge” (M = 4.75, SD = 1.08). The top three motives to play “PaGamO” were “fun,” “self-learning,” and “want to get a higher grade in the final examination.” By using gamification as a tool for learning and studying, students did find “PaGamO” effective for their learning experience. Both intrinsic and extrinsic participation motives are reasons why students play “PaGamO.” Furthermore, due to its convenience, using mobile devices to play “PaGamO” is more popular than using computers and tablet devices. In conclusion, the combination of gamification and traditional learning methods can enhance students’ learning outcomes. © Copyright © 2021 Cheung and Ng.",educational game; intrinsic motivation; learning; perceptions; self-determinated motivation,,,,,,"Funding Scheme for Teaching and Learning Related Projects, (L/16-19); University Grants Committee of Hong Kong; Hong Kong Baptist University, HKBU","Funding text 1: We would like to thank our colleagues at the Centre for Holistic Teaching and Learning of Hong Kong Baptist University for supporting this study.

Gamification is one of the newer methods of education that has the potential to improve student learning. This research looked into gamification's efficacy in student engagement and learning retention during teaching and learning sessions for computer science or information technology courses. The assessment involved in this study is through Pre-Test and Post-Test through instructional intervention by adapting interactive Quizizz gamification e-learning web-based application. The flow of research works begins with a survey of the problem, pre-intervention analysis, and action was taken during the intervention, ending with the implementation and observation phase. The pre and post-analysis of test results and questionnaires were accomplished and discussed. Fifty-six respondents participate in this study. Results show that 87% of the respondents have increased their percentage of marks. In the pre-test result, 56% of the respondents achieved below the 55 marks, while in the post-test, it reduced to 14%. Adoption of other gamification applications, a larger target demographic, and the addition of computer science or information technology courses will help improve the study in the future. © 2022, Politeknik Negeri Padang.

In this article we present the tools used in the Management course at Instituto Superior Técnico involving, namely, simulation through management games, clickers and collaborative techniques useful for online lectures and with potential to help with engaging and providing feedback when managing a large number of students. The success of the application of these online methods is then evaluated and discussed, both under the teachers’ perspective and under the students’ perspective, the latter resorting to an online survey. Although before the pandemic the game ISTMC and the clickers were already used, these and other tools were used with higher impact in the last two years. The conclusions point out to very positive experiences with the online lecturing and to the possibility of further use of some of these in a blended online-classroom situation. © 2021 IEEE.",Collaborative tools; Gamification; Management education; Management games,E-learning; 'current; Academic work; Collaborative tools; Digital-learning; Distance learning tools; Gamification; Management course; Management education; Management games; Teaching managements; Students,,,,,,,"Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Programs, (2018); EUR-ACE Framework Standards for The Accreditation of Engineering Programmes, (2008); Developing Graduate Engineering Skills, (2016); Silva A., Figueiredo A.D., Teaching management to engineering students: Acting as a learning organization, Proc.

They aim at providing online education to an increasingly large and heterogeneous audience: school pupils, university students or professionals who intend to acquire or develop their skill to better respond to market needs. The growing number of learners (more than 100 million globally at the moment, https://www.classcentral.com/report/mooc-stats-2019/) and courses (over 11 thousand, ibidem) reveals new and unprecedented scenarios in lifelong learning paths. Offering educational products to such an audience requires producers – not only private individuals but also public entities – to evaluate new teaching methods and methodologies for distance learning, in order to encourage participation and reduce their dropping out. Using gamification within an online course seems to contribute to the growth of users’ participation rate, as well as to increase the course completion rate.

Lessons cannot be envisaged without the use of tools such as computers, tablets or mobile devices. Many lecturers use audience response systems (ARS) to keep their classes engaged. ARS software allows teachers to interact with students via polls, text responses, or multiple-choice questions displayed via their mobile devices. A new example of the use of this type of devices in education is gamification, a technique that uses a set of activities with ludic character as a learning methodology in order to facilitate the acquisition of knowledge and competences. One of the most used gamification tools is Kahoot!, a free learning application based on a mixture of game and creativity, which encourages attention and participation of students through questions and answers formulated by the teacher and designed in a way that students respond via their mobile phones. This paper examines the use of Kahoot! in a subject belonging to the chemistry area. In order to assess the benefits of this tool, it was tested in a group of students to review the knowledge and skills acquired during the theoretical lessons prior to the exams, and the academic results were compared with those of a control group of students who did not use the tool. The results demonstrate that the use of Kahoot! led to an improvement in the teaching–learning process of the students and a noteworthy rise in their marks, and that its positive effects rise with increasing the frequency of use of this didactic tool. © 2020 by the authors.

Higher education (HE) students struggle to master programming principles resulting in unsatisfactory pass rates, student retention and low levels of student engagement. Gamification in programming courses has been recognized as a prospective technique that could improve student participation as well as impact learning in a positive way. There is currently a shortage of review studies published in the last two years (2018-2019) that focus specifically on the gamification of programming courses in HE. The aim of this paper is to bridge this gap and to provide a comprehensive review of literature concerning studies that focused on the usage of gamification systems in the teaching of programming courses in HE from 2014 until 2019. Results indicate that the most popular gamification elements that were used in the reviewed studies were leaderboards, followed by points, badges and levels. Additionally, in terms of the tools or instruments that were used to implement gamification solutions, it was discovered that the development of a new gamification platform and the usage of existing gamification tools were the most wide-spread method for gamification implementation. Lastly, from the studies that were reviewed, it was evident that gamification of HE programming courses had a very positive impact on student engagement, student programming knowledge and student motivation. This review paper fills a void in existing literature and could therefore serve as a valuable resource for academe that consider gamifying HE programming courses. © 2020 IEEE.",Gamification; Higher education; Programming courses; Review; State of the art,"Computer programming; Curricula; Engineering education; Gamification; Students; Computer programming course; Programming course; Programming knowledge; Programming principles; Student engagement; Student motivation; Student participation; Teaching-of-programming; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics)",,,,,,,"Leibowitz G., Steve Jobs Believed Everyone Should Learn This 1 Skill, (2017); Munoz C., Smith M., As Computer Science Education Week Approaches: Calling All CS Learning Champions !, (2015); Du J., Wimmer H., Rada R., Hour of code': Can it change students' attitudes toward programming?, J.

In the methodology used, the field procedure was complex due to the circumstances, for this reason, relationships with reality were established through a systematic analysis to explain causes and effects. The ADDIE method was used, which consists of providing learning experiences with the design of digital teaching. The research is qualitative, highlighting the interviews with the instrument: a script of open questions applied to teachers of initial level II 4 and 5-year-old children. This instrument led to the development of a document that relates the study variables. The level of research was managed as explanatory, which was adapted to the focus of the research phenomenon. The exploratory approach allowed the investigation of information to fully understand the research topic and the obtaining of systematic data for the study variables. As a result, when carrying out the analysis of the categories, it can be mentioned that the use of interactive education 3.0 resources stimulates learning through auditory and visual experiences when teaching prevention measures for COVID-19. Finally, it can be concluded that the tools that are used to create interactive education 3.0 resources in teaching prevention measures for COVID-19 are easily accessible for teachers. With these tools, children from 4-5 years of age can observe each of the visual, auditory, and tactile elements created by the teachers. Educaplay, Prezzi, Power Point, Canva and Geneally are resources that facilitate communication and participation in the virtual classroom thanks to tools such as Zoom, Teams and social networks, which in turn provide greater interaction. © 2022 IEEE.",education; gamification; ICT; meaningful learning; v-learning,Early childhood educations; Field procedures; Gamification; ICT; Interactive education; Meaningful learning; Prevention measures; Systematic analysis; Teachers'; V-learning; Educational technology,,,,,,,"Gupta S., Jawanda M.K., The impacts of COVID-19 on children, Acta Paediatr, pp. 2181-2183, (2020); Roy R.V., Zaman B., Need-supporting Gamification in Education: An Assessment of Motivational Effects over Time, pp. 283-297, (2018); Sir J., Education and the COVID-19 Pandemic, pp. 91-96, (2020); Coronel T., From blackboards to screens, a teaching challenge in Ecuador, Mamakuna, 16, pp. 48-55, (2021); Majuri J., Koivisto J., Hamari J., Gamification of education and learning: A review of empirical literature, De Proceedings of the 2nd International GamiFIN Conference, (2018); Hallifax S., Serna A., Marty J.-C., Lavoue E., Adaptive Gamification in Education: A Literature Review of Current Trends and Developments, pp. 294-307, (2019); Pablos-Mendez A., Vega J., Petersen F., Tabish H., Raviglione M., Covid-19 in Latin America, BMJ, (2020); Tadesse S., Muluye W., The impact of covid-19 pandemic on education system in developing countries: A review, Open Journal of Social Sciences, pp. 159-170, (2020); Aristovnik A., Kerzic D., Ravselj D., Tomazevic N., Umek L., Impacts of the covid-19 pandemic on life of higher education students: A global perspective, Sustainability, pp. 12-20, (2020); Sarmiento W., Erreyes J., Quinllin J., Yamba D., Educación virtual como herramienta tecnológica de apoyo en nivel superior ecuatoriano, Dialnet, pp. 95-115, (2020); Plan Educativo COVID 19, (2020); Leonardo Z., Use of information and communication technology in virtual education and its correlation with the emotional intelligence of teachers in Ecuador in a COVID-19 context, RISTI-Revista Ibérica de Sistemas e Tecnologias de Informação, pp. 31-44, (2020); Ayon E., Cevallos A., La virtualidad en los procesos de formación educativa.

Although research in the field has previously looked into the effectiveness of gamification, reviews of existing studies show that in the context of education, gamification has been largely applied at the university level, with diverse pedagogical approaches and outcomes. Furthermore, reports often refer to interactions with gamification elements in contexts outside STEM education. To bridge these research gaps, this paper reports on an empirical study involving 199 students from two secondary schools. Students had the opportunity to receive a digital reward (in the form of points, badges, or rankings) for their participation in an online physics lesson.

Our gamification approach was based on the self-determination theory. According to this theory, people need to have competence, social connectedness, and autonomy in order to feel determined to perform certain activities. We aimed to investigate the effects of teaching presence in online gamification on sustainability learning and self-determination as well as identify the driving factors and barriers to sustaining students' participation in online gamified activity. A mobile application called JouleBug was used. It contains game elements and aims to encourage pro-environmental behaviours. Our quasi-experimental design included two university courses (as control and treatment groups) on sustainable education with 48 participants. Both groups worked with JouleBug, whereas the treatment group was also supported by their teacher's teaching presence. To establish online teaching presence, the teacher shares the students' leader board rankings, acknowledges the students' achievements, and give comments and feedback on students' activities in the chatting group twice a week. Sustainability knowledge and pro-environmental behaviour were measured through survey. Students' performance in the gamified activities was measured through collected points in the JouleBug application. The drivers and barriers to sustaining the students' participation in JouleBug activities were identified through focus group interviews and students' reflection writing. We found there were significant differences in the sustainability knowledge, pro-environmental behaviour, and performance between the treatment and control groups. The Cohen's d effect size value obtained for the treatment on sustainability knowledge, pro-environmental behaviour, and students' performance indicates a large effect as well. Focus group interviews with the participants and the students' reflection writings revealed that the driving factors in sustaining the participation in the gamified activities in the application are recognition by teachers and peers, competition, and sense of belonging to a group. Meanwhile, the barriers to sustaining participation in online gamification are time constraints, boredom caused by lack of social interaction, and boredom caused by activity repetition and activity's inappropriate level of difficulty. The conclusion is the teacher plays a role as an agent in this online gamification learning context. The findings suggest that teaching presence is one of the important building blocks that encourage the students' participation and learning in online gamification. © 2020 by the authors.",Environmental education; Gamification; Higher education; Mobile apps; Online learning; Self-determination theory,autonomy; education; experimental design; knowledge; learning; local participation; recognition; self determination; sustainability; teaching,,,,,"Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, (GG-2019-080)","Funding: This research was funded by the Faculty of Education, The National University of Malaysia (grant number GG-2019-080).","Filho W.L., Skanavis C., Paco A.D., Rogers J., Kuznetsova O., Castro P., Handbook of Theory and Practice of Sustainable Development in Higher Education, 2, (2017); Ones D.S., Wiernik B.M., Dilchert S., Klein R., Pro-Environmental Behavior, International Encyclopedia of the Social & Behavioral Sciences, pp. 82-88, (2015); University Leaders for a Sustainable Future, (1990); Agenda 21, Rio Declaration, (1992); SeventhMalaysia Plan 1996-2000, (1996); Albareda-Tiana S., Garcia-Gonzalez E., Jimenez-Fontana R., Solis-Espallargas C., Implementing pedagogical approaches for ESD in initial teacher training at Spanish Universities, Sustainability, 11, (2019); Lohrmann C., Online Learning-Do MOOCs Contribute to the Goals of Agenda 21: In Education for Sustainable Development, Sustainability in a Digital World: New Opportunities Through New Technologies, pp. 211-244, (2017); Morganti L., Pallavicini F., Cadel E., Candelieri A., Archetti F., Mantovania F., Gaming for Earth: Serious games and gamification to engage consumers in pro-Environmental behaviours for energy efficiency, Energy Res.

Common barriers to RCA education and participation include faculty time and materials, trainee time constraints, and learner engagement. Methods: We developed a simulated RCA workshop to be taught to a mix of medical and surgical specialties from over 11 GME programs and to third-year medical students. The workshop was a single 90-minute session formatted as a gamified mystery dinner including characters and sequentially revealed clues to promote engagement. Participant satisfaction and subjective knowledge, skills, and attitudes were assessed with a pre/post survey. Results: The workshop was completed by 134 learners between October 2018 and October 2019. The short workshop duration and premade simulation allowed a small number of faculty to train a wide variety of learners in various educational settings. Participants' presurvey (124 out of 134, 92%) versus postsurvey (113 out of 134, 84%) responses showed that attitudes about RCA were statistically improved across all domains queried, with an average effect size of 0.6 (moderate effect); 91% of participants would recommend this course to a colleague. Discussion: A 90-minute, gamified, simulated RCA workshop was taught to medical students and multiple GME specialties with subjective improvements in patient safety attitudes and knowledge while alleviating faculty time constraints in case development. © 2021 Smeraglio et al.",Games; Gamification; Health Systems; Interdisciplinary Medicine; Interprofessional Education; Quality Improvement/Patient Safety; Root Cause Analysis; Simulation,"Curriculum; Humans; Meals; Patient Safety; Root Cause Analysis; Students, Medical; curriculum; human; meal; medical student; patient safety; root cause analysis",,,,,,,,,,NLM (Medline),,,,,,23748265,,,34222649,English,MedEdPORTAL,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85110874129,Spain

Education and training have been historically struggling with keeping 'students' motivated to pursue the completion of their learning paths. Lately these issues have been exacerbated by distance education: on the one hand, virtual participation to courses makes education far more accessible than requiring students to seat in the same classroom (and at the same time); on the other hand, the missing 'community building' conveyed by physically attending the same course remarkably reduces students' engagement. In this respect, gamification has been applied as an engagement tool, e.g. in programming courses, by introducing challenges, awards, leader boards, and so forth, with the aim of motivating the students in keeping their efforts for completing their studies.In this paper we describe and compare our experiences in gamification solutions for programming and modelling. In particular, we distinguish some desirable features to have in gamification solutions for modelling courses, and illustrate our experiences in realizing them concretely. Our observations testify that while in principle many of the gamification elements coming from programming courses could be suitable also to engage students in modelling, there exist still remarkable obstacles in realizing them in practice. © 2021 IEEE.",Gamification; Modeling Education; Research Challenges; Software Modeling; Vision,Education computing; Students; Community buildings; Education and training; Gamification; Learning paths; Modeling education; Programming course; Research challenges; Software modeling; Student engagement; User need; Distance education,,,,,,,"Leonardou A., Rigou M., Garofalakis J., Techniques to motivate learner improvement in game-based assessment, Information, 11, 4, pp. 1-18, (2020); Pintrich P.R., De Groot E.V., A motivational science perspective on the role of student motivation in learning and teaching contexts, Journal of Educational Psychology, 95, 4, pp. 667-686, (2003); Saleem A.N., Noori N.M., Ozdamli F., Gamification applications in e-learning: A literature review, Technology, Knowledge and Learning, (2021); Awais M., Habiba U., Khalid H., Shoaib M., Arshad S., An adaptive feedback system to improve student performance based on collaborative behavior, Ieee Access, 7, pp. 107171-107178, (2019); Li C.H., Gamification of an asynchronous html5-related competency-based guided learning system, Iop Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering, 658, 1, (2019); Brooks C.F., Toward 'hybridised' faculty development for the twentyfirst century: Blending online communities of practice and face-Toface meetings in instructional and professional support programmes, Innovations in Education and Teaching International, 47, 3, pp. 261-270, (2010); Deterding S., Dixon D., Khaled R., Nacke L.E., From game design elements to gamefulness: Defining ""gamification, Proceedings of the 15th International Academic MindTrek Conference: Envisioning Future Media Environments, MindTrek 2011, pp. 9-15, (2011); Mese C., Dursun O.O., Influence of gamification elements on emotion, interest and online participation, Egitim Ve Bilim, 43, 196, pp. 67-95, (2018); Bai S., Hew K.F., Huang B., Does gamification improve student learning outcome evidence from a meta-Analysis and synthesis of qualitative data in educational contexts, Educational Research Review, 30, (2020); Paiva J.C., Leal J.P., Queiros R., Fostering programming practice through games, Information (Switzerland), 11, 11, pp. 1-20, (2020); Koivisto J., Hamari J., The rise of motivational information systems: A review of gamification research, International Journal of Information Management, 45, pp. 191-210, (2019); De-Marcos L., Garcia-Cabot A., Garcia-Lopez E., Accepted manuscript: Towards the social gamification of e-learning: A practical experiment, International Journal of Engineering Education, 1, pp. 1-14, (2017); Gonzalez A., Turning a traditional teaching setting into a feedbackrich environment, International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education, 15, 1, pp. 1-21, (2018); Mahmud S.N.D., Husnin H., Soh T.M.T., Teaching presence in online gamified education for sustainability learning, Sustainability (Switzerland), 12, 9, pp. 1-17, (2020); Von Wangenheim C.G., Shull F., To game or not to game, Ieee Software, 26, 2, pp. 92-94, (2009); Mead N., Carter D., Lutz M., The state of software engineering education and training, Software, 14, 12, pp. 22-25, (1997); Lutz M.J., Bagert D., Guest editors' introduction: Software engineering curriculum development, Ieee Software, 23, 6, pp. 16-18, (2006); Dalpiaz F., Cooper K.M., Games for requirements engineers: Analysis and directions, Ieee Software, 37, 1, pp. 50-59, (2020); Marin B., Frez J., Cruz-Lemus J., Genero M., An empirical investigation on the benefits of gamification in programming courses, Acm Transactions on Computing Education, 19, 1, pp. 1-22, (2019); Robins A., Rountree J., Rountree N., Learning and teaching programming: A review and discussion, International Journal of Phytoremediation, 21, 1, pp. 137-172, (2003); Jurgelaitis M., Ceponiene L., Ceponis J., Drungilas V., Implementing gamification in a university-level uml modeling course: A case study, Computer Applications in Engineering Education, 27, 2, pp. 332-343, (2019); Jurgelaitis M., Ceponiene L., Ceponis J., Drungilas V., Implementing gamification in a university-level uml modeling course: A case study, Computer Applications in Engineering Education, 27, 2, pp. 332-343, (2019); Jurgelaitis M., Drungilas V., Ceponiene L., Gamified moodle course for teaching uml, Balt.

One of the transformations is practicing blended learning, such as a flipped classroom, to produce better quality student learning outcomes. However, based on previous studies, there are difficulties in maintaining student engagement during learning activities, even though blended learning offers some advantages. Therefore, this study suggests the development of a mobile application using gamification as a solution to enhance student participation. This paper proposes the design and development research (DDR) approach with the adaptation of the ADDIE model to build a learning content prototype. It involves five phases: analysis, design, development, implementation, and evaluation. The study participants consisted of two groups of students in the 1st semester of the Interactive Multimedia course from two different TVET institutions who were cleft into a control group and an experimental group. The experimental group is gamified, whereas the control group is not. The study evaluation uses two instruments: a test to compare students' understanding of both groups and an activity log to track the experimental group's use of the prototype. According to the findings, gamification during learning activities can increase student engagement by boosting performance through a more significant pre-and post-test mean score difference and creating a positive learning experience. Additionally, mobile applications with the gamification concept can be employed extensively in various TVET courses to encourage student learning performance © 2022, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.All Rights Reserved.",Engagement; Flipped classroom; Gamification; Mobile application; Technical and vocational education and training (tvet),Apprentices; Curricula; E-learning; Education computing; Interactive computer systems; Learning systems; Mobile computing; Multimedia systems; Blended learning; Engagement; Experimental groups; Flipped classroom; Gamification; Learning Activity; Mobile applications; Student engagement; Technical and vocational education and training; Technical and vocational education and trainings; Students,,,,,,,"Dokadawa M.

How to evaluate if engagement takes place in a hybrid virtual lecture is challenging. This research proposes an analysis of student engagement in a hybrid virtual lecture in order to identify if interventions are required to support the learning environment. Engagement metrics such as skills, emotional and performance and participation are identified from the student course engagement questionnaire. Students that have disengaged from the course are given interventions such as interactive digital elements, feedback, direct communication, and group activities. Results demonstrate that emotional engagement has a high focus during the assessment periods representing affective engagement of student feelings, attitudes, and perceptions towards the learning. In response the lecture was adjusted to include emotional interactions such as activities in which students relate course concepts to personal development. Results show promise for the identification of interventions.  © 2022 IEEE.",Education; Engagement; Gamification; Lecture Capture; Machine Learning; Remote Learning; Virtual Classroom,Behavioral research; Computer aided instruction; Curricula; E-learning; Machine learning; Digital elements; Engagement; Gamification; Learning environments; Lecture capture; Machine-learning; Performance; Remote learning; Student engagement; Virtual Classroom; Students,,,,,,,"Lee J.J.J., Hammer J., Gamification in Education: What, How, Why Bother?, Acad.

Programming is a challenging and highly important topic for introducing learners to our digital world. Research has shown that motivation plays a key role in programming performance. Gamification using digital badges has the potential to influence motivation, provide social recognition and encourage learner participation. More research is recommended to evaluate its motivational impact in different contexts. Intervention. This research explores the effects of badges on the intrinsic motivation levels of introductory programming students within a higher education institution. The course is offered during the first year of the programme. We report the results of a baseline study without badges and four subsequent badge experiments of different designs over a four-year period. Methods. This quasi-experimental study followed a pre-test/post-test design to measure the effects of badges on the intrinsic motivation levels of university-level introductory programming students. Badges were designed and implemented. Feedback via focus groups and a post-badge survey was collected. Results. Findings are inconclusive as the quantitative results suggest that badges did not increase intrinsic motivation scores. Contrastingly, badge survey and qualitative data indicate that badges were received more positively on average. Discussion. We analyse and discuss the results within the context of motivation and the programming discipline, and discuss external factors that may impact the relationship between gamification and motivation. Conclusion. Further research is necessary to investigate whether gamification, through the use of digital badges, can foster positive intrinsic motivational results, particularly in the well-known challenging domain of introductory programming. © The Author(s) 2019.",digital badges; gamification; higher education; intrinsic motivation; introductory programming,,,,,,,,"Abramovich S., Schunn C., Higashi R.M., Are badges useful in education?

The interests of citizens are coming to the forefront nowadays with the awareness that a livable city does not only consist of good infrastructure and sustainable energy supply but also citizen input and feedback. The project consists of a transversal research at the intersection between computer science, the teaching of future architects and multimedia engineers and the urban policies of the cities of the future in which citizen participation is fundamental. The hypothesis is based on demonstrating the following two statement: (1) The implementation of virtual gamified strategies in the field of urban design will generate an improvement in citizen participation by being a more dynamic, real and agile collaborative environment thanks to enhanced visual technologies and immersive. (2) Gamified strategies for the understanding of three-dimensional space improve spatial competencies of students generating greater motivation in their use and a degree of satisfaction high. First, we studied the contemporary student profile and better ways of teaching according to it.

This context has informed the development of a literature that is heavily influenced by cause-effect framing and a focus on effectiveness. However, in recent years an alternative, critical literature has emerged that challenges some of the assumptions of the student engagement movement on the grounds of student rights and freedoms as learners. This review article identifies the following six critiques of student engagement based on an analysis of the literature and arguments stemming from analyses of the effects of neoliberalism, namely performativity, marketing, infantilisation, surveillance, gamification and opposition. It is concluded that at a policy and institutional governance level, there is a need to shift the emphasis from what and how questions concerning student engagement to consider its broader political, economic and ethical implications as a means of challenging the prevailing policy narrative. © 2016 International Association of Universities.",gamification; infantilisation; marketing; neoliberalism; opposition; performativity; student engagement; surveillance,,,,,,,,"Attracting, Engaging and Retaining: New Conversations about Learning, (2008); Ashwin P., McVitty D., The meanings of student engagement: Implications for policies and practices, The European Higher Education Area: Between Critical Reflections and Future Policies, pp. 343-359, (2015); Barnett R., Does higher education have aims, Journal of Philosophy of Education, 22, 2, pp. 239-250, (1988); Brannick T., Coghlan D., In defense of being ""native"": The case of insider academic research, Organisational Research Methods, 10, 1, pp. 59-74, (2007); Brown R., Carasso H., Everything for Sale: The Marketisation of UK Higher Education, (2013); Boud D., Using journal writing to enhance reflective practice, New Directions for Adult and Continuing Education, 90, 1, pp. 9-17, (2001); Coates H., McCormick A.C., Engaging University Students: International Insights from System-Wide Studies, (2014); Collini S., What Are Universities for, (2012); Danvers E.C., Criticality's affective entanglements: Rethinking emotion and critical thinking in higher education, Gender and Education, (2015); Dawson S., The impact of institutional surveillance technologies on student behaviour, Surveillance & Society, 4, 1-2, pp. 69-84, (2006); Fulfilling Our Potential: Teaching Excellence, (2015); Higher Education: Success As A Knowledge Economy-White Paper, (2016); Ecclestone K., Hayes D., The Dangerous Rise of Therapeutic Education, (2009); Edmond N., Berry J., Discourses of 'equivalence' in HE and notions of student engagement: Resisting the neoliberal university, Student Engagement and Experience Journal, (2014); Evans C., Muijs D., Tomlinson M., Engaged Student Learning: High-Impact Strategies to Enhance Student Achievement, (2015); Fejes A., Dahlstedt M., The confessing society: Foucault, Confession and Practices of Lifelong Learning, (2013); Foucault M., Discipline and Punishment, (1977); Fredricks J.A., Blumenfeld P.C., Paris A.H., School engagement: Potential of the concept, state of the evidence, Review of Educational Research, 74, 1, pp. 59-109, (2004); Furedi F., Therapy Culture: Creating Vulnerability in An Uncertain Age, (2004); Gilmore S., Anderson V., The emotional turn in higher education: A psychoanalytic contribution, Teaching in Higher Education, (2016); Giroux H.A., Neoliberalism's War on Higher Education, (2014); Gourlay L., Student engagement and the tyranny of participation, Teaching in Higher Education, 20, 4, pp. 402-411, (2015); Hammersley M., Philosophy's contribution to social science research on education, Philosophy, Methodology and Educational Research, pp. 251-264, (2007); Hobbs V., Faking it or hating it: Can reflective practice be forced, Reflective Practice, 8, 3, pp. 405-417, (2007); Kahn P., Theorising student engagement in higher education, British Educational Research Journal, 40, 6, pp. 1005-1018, (2014); Kahu E.R., Framing student engagement in higher education, Studies in Higher Education, 38, 5, pp. 758-773, (2013); Kuh G.D., Kinzie J., Buckley J.A., Bridges B.K., Hayek J.C., What Matters to Student Success: A Review of the Literature.

It is evidential that Gamification increases participation, motivation and engagement. However, gamification design and implementation fail to achieve desirable outcome in education due to poor design and mainly the gamification environment that is being gamified. This research paper is aimed at mapping game elements in a well-known generally accepted Learning Management System. This provides a gamification environment that addresses limitation of gamification in education. A gamified course in learning management system (GCLMS) is developed to study increase in student, learning from GCLMS. Steps and levels of the gamification environment is shown with an evidential prove of how GCLMS increase students learning through an initial evaluation. Feedback results from students increase in learning and confidence in applying what they learnt from the GCLMS in real life scenario.

To test whether gamification could be used to engage low-motivation smokers, we conceptualized ""Take a Break"" - a 3-week technology-assisted challenge for smokers to compete in setting and achieving brief abstinence goals. Materials and Methods: In the feasibility study of the multi-technology Take a Break challenge, low-motivation smokers were given (1) daily motivational messages, (2) brief ""challenge quizzes"" related to smoking behaviors, (3) a telehealth call to personalize their abstinence goal for the challenge, (4) ""coping minigames"" to help manage cravings while attempting to achieve their brief abstinence goals, and (5) a leaderboard ""webApp,"" providing comparative feedback on smokers' participation, and allowing for competition. Heterogeneity of engagement was tracked. Results: All 41 smokers initially reported that they were not actively quitting. Over half were employed less than full time (51%), completed less than a 4-year college education (76%), and experienced financial stress (54%). No smokers opted out of the motivational messages, and mean proportion of response to the challenge quizzes was 0.88 (SD = 0.19). Half of the smokers reported using the ""coping minigames."" Almost all set abstinence goals (78%), with over half lasting 1-2 days (51%); median = 1 day (IQR 1-7). Leaderboard points ranged widely. Conclusions: Rates of smoking in the developed world have declined, and those who remain smokers are complex and have lower motivation to quit. Using a game-inspired challenge, we achieved high levels of engagement from low-motivation smokers. © 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Digital technology; eHealth; Game design theory; Motivational intervention; Tobacco cessation; Usability and feasibility testing,Adult; Feasibility Studies; Female; Health Promotion; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Smokers; Smoking Cessation; Software Design; adult; education; feasibility study; female; health promotion; human; male; middle aged; procedures; psychology; smoking; smoking cessation; software design,,,,,"Center for Health care Organization and Implementation Research, (K07 CA172677); University of Massachusetts Medical School’s Center for Clinical and Translational Science, (1UL1RR031982-01 U54); National Cancer Institute, NCI, (K07CA172677, R01 CA190866-01A1); Health Services Research and Development, HSR&D",Funding for the study was received from the National Cancer Institute (R01 CA190866-01A1).

In order to cope with such a problem, we proposed the use of gamification as a technology to increase the students’ motivation and engagement in CL scenarios. As consequence of increasing the motivation of students, we assume a reduction in the desistance of CL activities when the scripted collaboration is gamified. However, gamification is a complex task that requires knowledge about game elements (such as leaderboards and point systems), game design (e.g. how to combine game elements) and their impact on motivation and learning. To address these issues, we have developed an ontology that aims to give structured guidance on how to gamify CL scenarios. In the study presented here, we focused on describing the ontology and how it is used to gamify CL scenarios. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach to deal with the motivation problem through an empirical study in which the students enrolled in the introduction to computer Science course at the university of São Paulo participated in either non-gamified CL sessions or ontology-based gamified CL sessions. Significant differences were found in the students’ intrinsic motivation and the percentage of students by groups who had incomplete participation in the CL session. The students who participated in ontology-based gamified sessions reported to be more intrinsic motivated than the students who participated in non-gamified CL sessions, and the percentage of students by groups who had incomplete participation was significantly less in ontology-based gamified sessions than in non-gamified CL sessions. These results indicate that our approach can be used to deal with the motivational problem caused by the scripted collaboration. They also validate the assumption that the gamification of CL scenarios can be used to reduce the desistance of students in CL activities when CSCL scripts are used as a method to orchestrate and structure collaboration. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.",Collaboration scripts; CSCL; Gamification; Motivation; Ontology,Distance education; Engineering education; Motivation; Ontology; Semantics; Collaboration scripts; Collaborative learning; Computer Science course; CSCL; Empirical studies; Gamification; Intrinsic motivation; Motivation and engagements; Students,,,,,"Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq","This work was partially funded by CNPq, CAPES and FAPESP.","Andrade F., Et al., QPJ-BR: Questionário para Identificação de Perfis de Jogadores para o Português-Brasileiro, XXVII Brazilian Symposium on Computers in Education, Maceio, Brazil, pp. 637-646, (2016); Bleumers L., Et al., State of play of digital games for empowerment and inclusion: A review of the literature and empirical cases, Eur.

This study held an “understanding sequence” for 20 classes during the 7-week automation equipment class with 30 s year high school students in Incheon's specialized technical high school as target. After the class, the learning attitude of learners was measured through surveys and in-depth interviews. As a result, first, it was found that the degree of preparation participation in flip learning using gaming elements had a statistically significant increase from 65.56% to 78.89%, compared with the traditional flip learning using YouTube. Second, comparing the academic achievements showed a diagnostic assessment of 57.44 before applying the gaming elements and 20.17 after the application. However, for summative assessment, the degree after applying gaming elements was statistically higher at 84.52 than the degree before application, which was 78.86. Third, comparing academic achievement with word game results showed no significant correlation, and it is judged that all students were able to enjoy word games, regardless of their grades. Also, when the average word game scores were compared based on students’ grades, mid-upper level students had statistically significant higher scores than upper level students. Lastly, analysis on the correlation between attitude and word game showed that there is a quantitatively high correlation between the ranking system's competitive spirit and interest. The ranking system increased competitive spirit, as well as interest. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",e-assessment; flipped learning; gamification; online education,Distance education; Academic achievements; Automation equipment; E assessments; flipped learning; Gamification; High school students; On-line education; Summative assessments; Students,,,,,"Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, MCST, (R2016030031); National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF, (NRF-2016R1A2B2015912)","National Research Foundation of Korea, Grant number: NRF-2016R1A2B2015912; Ministry of Culture, Sport and Tourism, Grant number: R2016030031","Bai D.-Y., A case study of the flipped learning classes at the university, Urimal, 41, pp. 179-202, (2015); Bergmann J., Sams A., (2012); Choi J.B., Kang S.C., A study on elements and procedure of instruction consulting for successful flipped learning, J.

The challenge for medical educators is to design pedagogical approaches capable of bonding students and teachers into the same community of practice (CoP). In this work, the authors explored how Social Media and Gamification strategies sum up to boost medical students’ participation in a blended learning strategy to teach Emergency Medicine. Method: Final year medical students (n = 462) from 5 consecutive years were included in a longitudinal study with historical controls and were divided into three groups. The first group (CONTROL; n = 125) had access to a blended learning strategy; the second group (FACE; n = 179) had access to the blended learning strategy and interacted with a fictional facilitator in Social Media; and the third group (GAME; n = 158) had access to the former strategies plus a gamification approach. Results: Social media and gamification progressively increased students’ participation in the online course as measured by the number of hours logged on from an average of 60 h in CONTROL to 87 h in FACE and 140 h in GAME (P < 0.01). There was a positive and significant correlation between students’ grades on cognitive tests and OSCEs exams with the online participation. Both strategies nurtured students’ sense of belonging to the community of Emergency Medicine and improved their self-regulation to study. Discussion: Social Media and Gamification catalyzed the consolidation of a shared identity for students and teachers, which fostered the creation of a community of practice and increased the participation of students in learning activities. © 2018 King Saud bin AbdulAziz University for Health Sciences",Community of practice; Gamification; Medical education; Social media,article; autoregulation; catalysis; controlled study; emergency medicine; human; human experiment; identity; learning; longitudinal study; major clinical study; medical education; medical student; rotation; social media; teacher,,,,,,,"Holmboe E., Ginsburg S., Bernabeo E., The rotational approach to medical education: time to confront our assumptions?, Med Educ, 45, 1, pp. 69-80, (2011); Van der Vleuten C., Driessen E., What would happen to education if we take education evidence seriously?, Perspec Med Educ, 3, 3, pp. 222-232, (2014); Williams L.L., Levine J.B., Malhotra S., Holtzheimer P., The good-enough mentoring relationship, Acad Psych, 28, 2, pp. 111-115, (2004); Straus S.E., Chatur F., Taylor M., Issues in the mentor–mentee relationship in academic medicine: a qualitative study, Acad Med, 84, 1, pp. 135-139, (2009); Teunissen P., Scheele F., Scherpbier A., Van Der Vleuten C., Boor K., Van Luijk S., Et al., How residents learn: qualitative evidence for the pivotal role of clinical activities, Med Educ, 41, 8, pp. 763-770, (2007); Dornan T., Boshuizen H., King N., Scherpbier A., Experience‐based learning: a model linking the processes and outcomes of medical students׳ workplace learning, Med Educ, 41, 1, pp. 84-91, (2007); Pander T., Pinilla S., Dimitriadis K., Fischer M.R., The use of Facebook in medical education–a literature review, GMS Z für Med Ausbild, 31, 3, (2014); Hoberts D.H., Newman L.R., Schwartzstein R.M., Twelve tips for facilitating Millennials׳ learning, Med Teach, 34, pp. 274-278, (2012); Tooley S.L., Wray A., Wiechmann W., Lin M., Boysen-Osborn M., Ten tips for engaging the millennial learner and moving an emergency medicine residency curriculum into the 21st century, West J Med, 17, 3, pp. 337-343, (2016); Aronsson G., Theorell T., Grape T., Hammarstron A., Hogstedt C., Matreisndottir I., Et al., A systematic review including meta-analysisof work environment and burnout symptoms, BMC Public Health, 17, (2017); Wenger E., (1996); Wenger E., Communities of Practice: Learning, Meaning, and Identity, (1998); Li L.C., Grimshaw J.M., Nielsen C., Judd M., Coyte P.C., Graham I.D., Evolution of Wenger׳s concept of community of practice, Implement Sci, 4, 1, (2009); Cruess R.L., Cruess S.R., Steinert Y., Medicine as a community of practice: implications for medical education, Acad Med, 93, 2, pp. 185-191, (2018); Wenger E.C., Snyder W.M., Communities of practice: the organizational frontier, Harv Bus Rev, 78, 1, pp. 139-146, (2000); Wenger E., Communities of practice and social learning systems, Organization, 7, 2, pp. 225-246, (2000); Wenger E., McDermott R.A., Snyder W., Cultivating Communities of Practice: a Guide to Managing Knowledge, (2002); Baker A., Beames S., Good CoP: what makes a community of practice successful?, J Learn Des, 9, 1, pp. 72-79, (2016); Usoro A., Sharratt M.W., Tsui E., Shekhar S., Trust as an antecedent to knowledge sharing in virtual communities of practice, Knowl Manag Res Pract, 5, 3, pp. 199-212, (2007); Mayer R.C., Davis J.H., Schoorman F.D., An integrative model of organizational trust, Acad Manag Rev, 20, 3, pp. 709-734, (1995); Flynn L., Jalali A., Moreau K.A., Learning theory and its application to the use of social media in medical education, Postgrad Med J, 91, 1080, pp. 556-560, (2015); Kennedy G., Gray K., Tse J., ‘Net Generation'medical students: technological experiences of pre-clinical and clinical students, Med Teach, 30, 1, pp. 10-16, (2008); Mayer R.E., Applying the science of learning to medical education, Med Educ, 44, pp. 543-549, (2010); Grangeia T.A.G., de Jorge B., Franci D., Et al., Cognitive load and self-determination theories applied to E-learning: impact on students׳ participation and academic performance, PloS One, 11, 3, (2016); Issa N., Schuller M., Santacaterina S., Shapiro M., Wang E., Mayer R.E., Et al., Applying multimedia design principles enhances learning in medical education, Med Educ, 45, pp. 818-826, (2011); Kind T., Patel P.D., Lie D., Chretien K.C., Twelve tips for using social media as a medical educator, Med Teach, 36, 4, pp. 284-290, (2014); ten Cate O.T.J., Kusurkar R.A., Williams G.C., How self-determination theory can assist our understanding of the teaching and learning processes in medical education.

Nevertheless, despite their potential, the application of SGs in education has been limited in terms of pedagogy. Several authors assert that this lack is because SG standards and guidelines have not been developed, and that there is an imbalance between the contribution from experts in education and game design specialists during the SG development. Specifically, methodologies that incorporate both game and pedagogical components in the requirements definition phase are necessary to develop serious games successfully. The definition of requirements must guide the development process. Many SG studies and projects indicates that games that are not well designed at the initial phase lose qualities and fail to fulfill pedagogical objectives. The goal of this study is to present a framework for a game design methodology that gives the gamer options for flexible participation in the game. We analyze the tasks associated with game design methodologies and serious educational games, especially those linked to gamers with non-standard cognitive abilities. Our approach identifies how educational innovation and the teaching-learning process contribute to game design. We propose an overall development focus based on a participatory, flexible, user-centered methodology adaptable to any type of gamer. © 2017 IEEE.",Education; Educational Innovation; Gamification; Participatory Design; Serious Games; Software Development; User-Centered Design,Education; Software design; Software engineering; User centered design; Development process; Educational environment; Educational innovations; Gamification; Participatory design; Requirements definition; Standards and guidelines; Teaching-learning process; Serious games,,,,,"Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Technology, and Innovation; Secretaría de Educación Superior, Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación, SENESCYT","Dr. José Aguilar has received partial financing from Proyecto Prometeo (Prometheus Project) from the Ministerio de Educación Superior, Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación (Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Technology, and Innovation) of the Republic of Ecuador.

However, by collaborating with schoolchildren, ideas to effectively promote health and learning in school can be identified. The purpose of this paper is to examine how a participatory approach can deepen the understanding of how schoolchildren relate to and use gamification as a tool to promote physical activity and learning. Design/methodology/approach: Inspired by the concept and process of empowerment and child participation, the methodological focus of this study was on consulting schoolchildren. During a two-month period, 18 schoolchildren (10-12 years old) participated in workshops to create game ideas that would motivate them to be physically active and learn in school. Findings: The phenomenological analysis resulted in one main theme, “Playing games for fun to be the best I can be.” This consisted of four themes with two sub-themes each. The findings offer insights on how to increase physical activity and health education opportunities using serious games in school. Originality/value: The knowledge gained provides gamification concepts and combinations of different technological applications to increase health and learning, as well as motivational aspects suggested by the schoolchildren. The findings are discussed with health promotion and health education in mind. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Children; Education; Empowerment; Games; Health promotion; Schools,article; child; empowerment; female; health promotion; human; human experiment; learning; male; physical activity; school child,,,,,Department of Health Sciences,"First of all, the authors would like to thank the 18 school children who shared their ideas concerning the development of an intervention to increase physical activity and learning using serious games in school.

Background: The family nurse practitioner program uses graduate Health Education Systems Incorporated examination as a quality indicator and program benchmark. A downward trend in Health Education Systems Incorporated examination scores stimulated a need for change. Two strategies were implemented to enhance engagement and improve synthesis of clinical information. Case-based learning and gamification involves the use of game thinking and game mechanics in non-game contexts to engage users in solving problems while the case-based discussions act as formative assessment tool, providing information on student's progress and development. Objectives: To assess the implementation of innovative strategies on the Health Education Systems Incorporated examination scores and to enhance students engagement and synthesis of clinical information. Method: Case presentations were created in the Learning Management System an online program, for every module. Interwoven throughout the module are various game elements. The game elements include voluntary participation with immediate feedback that can be both positive and negative and provides a social connection. The student has the freedom to fail and the freedom to choose without significant repercussions. Results: The results showed examination scores increased significantly. Using a one-way analysis of variance to compare Health Education Systems Incorporated examination scores between semester cohorts of students, followed by a post hoc pairwise comparison a statistically significant difference (p <.001) between previous semesters was identified. Conclusion: Although there are many approaches for online learning, using case presentations can mirror different social and cultural situations to challenge the learner. Case-based discussion and gamification strategies are effective in engaging students in a challenging environment. Student responded positively to case-base presentation with game elements. Using this approach is designed to challenge and add value to the learning experience. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Case-based learning; Engagement; Gamification; Online education,"Advanced Practice Nursing; Education, Distance; Education, Nursing, Baccalaureate; Educational Measurement; Games, Experimental; Humans; Problem-Based Learning; Students, Nursing; advanced practice nursing; analysis of variance; article; case report; clinical article; health education; human; human experiment; learning; mechanics; problem solving; student; synthesis; advanced practice nursing; education; game; nursing education; nursing student; problem based learning; procedures",,,,,,,"Allchin D., Problem- and case-based learning in science: an introduction to distinctions, values, and outcomes, CBE Life Sci.

Several studies state that the main limitations of the MOOCs are low completion and high dropout rates of participants. However, MOOCs suffer also from the lack of participant engagement, personalization, and despite the fact that several formats and types of MOOCs are reported in the literature, the majority of them contain a considerable amount of content that is mainly presented in a video format. This is in contrast to the results reported in other educational settings, where engagement and active participation are identified as success factors. We present the results of a study that involved educational experts and learning scientists giving new and interesting insights towards the conceptualization of a new design approach, the flipped MOOC, applying the flipped classroom approach to the MOOCs’ design and making use of gamification and learning analytics. We found important indications, applicable to the concept of a flipped MOOC, which entails turning MOOCs from mainly content-oriented delivery machines into personalized, interactive, and engaging learning environments. Our findings support the idea that MOOCs can be enriched by the orchestration of a flipped classroom approach in combination with the support of gamification and learning analytics. © 2018 by the authors.

In pursuit of energy efficiency and true sustainability, buildings must acquire the ability to interact as well as to generate synergies. The most prominent features of this approach are energy management and information flows which, intelligently designed, not only enhance buildings' capabilities, but also introduce a significant change in their relationship with the surrounds ('smart cities') and its inhabitants. This new paradigm calls for revisiting undergraduate architectural instruction, adopting a more complex overview of energy use and management in the design process, regarding buildings as dynamic rather than static entities. The methodology focuses on creating learning environments that favour students' participation in problem solving and assessment, encouraging teamwork based on case studies and stressing the connection between this new architecture, ICTs included, and social networks as participatory design tools. These ideas were implemented in a pilot learning experience conducted at the University of Seville for undergraduate students. The use of ICTs and the collaboration of non-academic experts were observed to further student promotion and projection beyond the academic environment and introduce them to the professional community. © 2018 Author(s).",Education; Energy efficiency; Gamification; Teaching innovation; Undergraduates,,,,,,"Beijing Municipal Authority; RACE; U.S. Department of Energy, USDOE; American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, ASHRAE","Examples of this approach include the work undertaken in previous years based on the ASHRAE Student Competition to design a building in China for the Beijing Municipal Authority and the present project that replicates the university competition sponsored by ASHRAE and the U.S. Department of Energy, RACE to ZERO.

Among other features, it enables lecturers to start quizzes that can be answered anonymously by students on their smartphones. This aims at both activating the students and giving them feedback about their understanding of the current content of the lecture. But even though many students use SMILE in the beginning of a course, the number of active participants tends to decrease as the term progresses. This paper reports the results of a study looking at incorporating gamification into SMILE to increase the students’ motivation and involvement. Game elements such as scores, badges and a leaderboard have been integrated paired with a post-processing feature enabling students to repeat SMILE quizzes outside of the lectures. The evaluations show that the gamification approach increased the participation in SMILE quizzes significantly. Copyright © 2019 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

Exceptional learner is an inclusive term that refers to students with learning and behavior problems, students with physical disabilities or sensory impairments, and students who are intellectually gifted or have a special talent. Computer games are increasingly part of the daily activities of students of all ages, and have been shown to support student motivation and learning however can be challenging to implement in the classroom. Gamification involves incorporating elements of computer games such as points, leaderboards, and badges into non-game contexts in order to take advantage of the motivation provided by a game environment. Based from literature analysis points, badges and achievements, leaderboards and levels are the most commonly implemented form of gamification.A study was conducted to determine to what extent gamification supports student achievement and motivation among exceptional learners. Incorporating gamification elements into exceptional learners' environments can motivate students and support student achievement.

Online quizzes have become a popular tool for students’ self and peer assessment in the education of occupational therapy, in which blended learning is becoming more commonly adopted. The use and creation of online quizzes is seen as a concrete case to explore how to enrich the practice of blended learning in the occupational therapy education, challenging the traditional notion of quizzes. This study was a cooperation between the Lillebaelt Academy’s Web Development education, and the Occupational Therapy education from the University College Lillebaelt, both in the area of Odense, Southern Denmark. Our study suggests that the use of quizzes poses complex questions in relation to the participation of teachers and students in creating quizzes and managing assessment. Hence teachers see quizzes as an opportunity for reducing their burden in assessment, but both teachers and students said that quizzes can be “dry” or “boring” and their best experiences with quizzes involved playful learning settings. Based on these findings, the Web Development students developed a series of hi-fi prototypes addressing two main issues: the need for making online quizzes more playful, and the need to support the workflow that takes place in the authoring and use of quizzes. This paper presents our findings, weaknesses of our study, and the relations between blended and playful learning. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.",Assessment; Blended learning; Gamification; Playful learning; Quiz,Occupational therapy; Students; Teaching; Assessment; Blended learning; Gamification; Playful learning; Quiz; E-learning,,,,,,,"Barnard-Ashton P., Rothberg A., McInerney P., The integration of blended learning into an occupational therapy curriculum: A qualitative reflection, BMC Med.

Gamification has become a very interesting resource to promote engagement and participation in a wide variety of areas including education. For this reason, researchers are increasingly interested in the study of gamification. There are many papers related to the impact that this methodology has on the student’s motivation, engagement or satisfaction. The aim of this paper is to analyze four aspects: “Pressure/tension”, “Perceived choice”, “Perceived competence” and “Effort/importance”. The first part of the study analyzes the aspects at two weeks between a test group and a control group. The second part is even more novel, because it analyzes the aspects when the test group is no longer gamified. Most studies focus on what happens when gamifying, but not when a group of students stops gamifying. The results obtained will serve to advance a part of the knowledge about gamification. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Effort; Gamification; Importance; Perceived choice; Perceived competence; Pressure; Tension,Artificial intelligence; Students; Control groups; Game elements; Perceived competence; Gamification,,,,,"Madrid Regional Government, (P2018/TCS-4307); Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO, (TIN2015-66731-C2-1-R); Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, URJC, (30VCPIGI15, UIDB/00408/2020, UIDP/00408/2020); European Regional Development Fund, FEDER","This work was supported by Ministerio de Economa y Competitividad (TIN2015-66731-C2-1-R), Rey Juan Carlos University (30VCPIGI15), the LASIGE Research-Unit (UIDB/00408/2020 & UIDP/00408/2020), and Madrid Regional Government, through the project e-MadridCM (P2018/TCS-4307).

New estimates by UNESCO reveal that 263 million children and youth are out of school. At the moment there exist no open source free online schools that do not expect a teacher to accompany the student journey. Without a teacher to help, a game environment can provide motivation, sequencing and content. The platform that we have been working on implements the framework for sorting educational games along the US common core standards. The current publication continues this work by adding the game interface that connects the external content with the child. A prototypical Role Playing Game (RPG) allows children to discover third party educational games leveled by grade and subject. The resulting game can be classified as a MOOC because it is an online course aimed at unlimited participation and open access via the web. The result of this work is the open source code of a game and an installed instance that can be used to connect third party games. The next step is to fill the underlying framework with educational games that hook into the various standards and evaluate the game with children. © 2018 IEEE.",common core standard; educational games; elementary school; gamification; global goals; MOOC,Open source software; Open systems; Teaching; Educational game; Elementary schools; Gamification; global goals; MOOC; Engineering education,,,,,,,"Leaving No One Behind: How Far on the Way to Universal Primary and Secondary Education?, (2016); Benavot A., Quan A., Education for People and Planet, Ser.

This paper presents the experience within a teaching innovation project of the University of Alcalá in Spain, mainly the gamification of several laboratory practices. The main objective of the project is to eliminate the negative prejudices, fear or rejection generated by students when studying science subjects, thus turning the learning process into a game, combining challenges and fun and which seeks the motivation of the students at the same time that acquires study habits and reaches a goal within the academic environment, causing significant improvement and less rejection of science within the learning process. The gamification has been applied in one subject which belongs to the curriculum of the Bachelor in Education of Primary Education: Didactics of Natural Science (DNS) of 3rd year, and it has been developed within more than 5 different groups of practices, with a participation of 150 students approximately. The objective of the practices has been to acquire the knowledge the methodology of gamification applied to education, and how to develop different practices in Geology and Biology through this technique. The gamification elements included are: the presentation of assumptions, use of avatars, division in levels, assign missions, design of badges, and define the scoring criteria, timeline and immediate feedback. From the beginning, the students will know what their objectives are in each of the levels and missions that are proposed. In addition, they will be motivated and committed to what they are learning through the use of badges (elements that will make the achievement achieved visually), scoring and the evolution of the assigned avatar. © The Authors, 2018.

One possible solution is to let the students self-select the problems they wish to attempt. The difficulty then becomes one of motivation and administration. This paper details our experiences with implementing a gamified system for practicals whereby students in CS1 and CS2 level courses receive points for various activities, including attendance, attempting basic problems, completing challenge problems and aiding fellow students with their work. These points have no bearing on final grades, but are displayed on a public leaderboard. In our experience, this gamified system dramatically improved attendance at practical sessions, was well received by students and TAs alike, improved retention rates, and offered students the opportunity and motivation to overcome poor performance early in the course and improve their results. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Computer science education; CS1; CS2; Engagement; Gamification; Practicals,Education; Education computing; Engineering education; Engineering research; Motivation; Challenge problems; Computer Science Education; Engagement; Gamification; Poor performance; Practicals; Retention rate; Students,,,,,,,"Beed P.L., Hawkins E.M., Roller C.M., Moving learners toward independence: The power of scaffolded instruction, The Reading Teacher, 44, 9, pp. 648-655, (1991); Bellotti F., Berta R., Gloria A.D., Lavagnino E., Antonaci A., Dagnino F.M., Ott M., A gamified short course for promoting entrepreneurship among ICT engineering students, 2013 IEEE 13th International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies, pp. 31-32, (2013); Buunk B.P., Gibbons F.X., Toward an Enlightenment in Social Comparison Theory, (2000); Camilleri V., Busuttil L., Montebello M., Social Interactive Learning in Multiplayer Games, (2011); Charles D., Charles T., McNeill M., Bustard D., Black M., Game-based feedback for educational multi-user virtual environments: Game-based feedback for educational MUVEs, British Journal of Educational Technology, 42, 4, pp. 638-654, (2011); Christy K.R., Fox J., Leaderboards in a virtual classroom: A test of stereotype threat and social comparison explanations for women's math performance, Computers & Education, 78, 5, pp. 66-77, (2014); De Marcos L., Dominguez A., De Navarrete J.S., Pages C., An empirical study comparing gamification and social networking on e-learning, Computers & Education, 75, 2, pp. 82-91, (2014); Festinger L., A theory of social comparison processes, Human Relations, 7, 2, pp. 117-140, (1954); Ganzalez C., Area M., Breaking the Rules: Gamification of Learning and Educational Materials, (2013); Hamari J., Koivisto J., Sarsa H., Does gamification work? - A literature review of empirical studies on gamification, 2014 47th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, pp. 3025-3034, (2014); Hanus M.D., Fox J., Assessing the effects of gamification in the classroom: A longitudinal study on intrinsic motivation, social comparison, satisfaction, effort, and academic performance, Computers & Education, 80, pp. 152-161, (2015); Hoorens V., Damme C.V., What do people infer from social comparisons?

Modern classroom technologies have presented educators the ease of using a variety of resources and tools for course delivery. Game-based learning (GBL) is an effective resource that can help teachers in engaging students having a wide variety of learning styles. It has the capability of enhancing creativity, problem solving, collaboration, achievement orientation, engagement, and a host of other related skills. Higher-education scenarios in Saudi Arabia (KSA), like many other countries, is replete with issues related to student participation and engagement. KSA, having advanced substantially with respect to technology adoption in education, has the required background to adapt GBL. A carefully implemented GBL programme will aid in ensuring student participation and engagement of indigenous students, which is the need of the hour. The present study analyses the possibility of utilizing GBL in dealing with the issues faced by the higher education sector in KSA. © 2017, UK Simulation Society.

A learning ecosystem that integrates a suitable pedagogical approach as well as technological tools could facilitate this process. This workshop includes presentations by the eCraft2Learn project funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 Framework, keynote speakers Sylvia Martinez and Gary Stager as well as interventions from the participant researchers and teachers. During the workshop, we will explore the idea of fostering the link between sciences, technology, engineering, and math with arts, in order to encourage the inclusive participation of students with all levels of technical skills and also to reduce the technology-triggered gender divide. The eCraft2Learn learning ecosystem will be described from its pedagogical underpinnings to the technical implementations that support the pedagogical approach including a unified user interface and a large set of tools for ideation, planning, creating, programming, and sharing. Within the eCraft2Learn learning ecosystem, support has been developed to enable children to create AI programs that rely upon cloud services [1], learning analytics provides guidance to teachers and coaches [2] [3], and a badge system fosters personalised learning path and self-regulation through gamification. Results from pilot studies will be shared. Presentations from participating international researchers that are working on making for learning will take place, as well as hands-on activities and demonstrations involving the entire audience. © 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).",Comprehensive education; Craft- and project-based pedagogy; Digital fabrication; Making,Ecosystems; Students; User interfaces; Digital fabrication; Hands-on activities; Learning ecosystems; Making; Pedagogical approach; Personalised learning; Project-based; Technical implementation; Engineering education,,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (731345)",,"Kahn K.M., Winters N., Child-friendly Programming Interfaces to AI Cloud Services, pp. 566-570, (2017); Jormanainen I., Sutinen E., Role blending in a learning environment supports facilitation in a robotics class, Journal of Educational Technology & Society, 17, 1, pp. 294-306, (2014); Suero Montero C., Suhonen J., Emotion analysis meets learning analytics: Online learner profiling beyond numerical data, Proceedings of the 14th Koli Calling International Conference on Computing Education Research, pp. 165-169, (2014); Suero Montero C., Voigt C., Makitalo K., From Digital Fabrication to Meaningful Creations: Pedagogical Perspectives, (2018)","C.S.

Gamification has become an essential part of modern life and society. The paper specifies the origin of the term ""gamification"" and compares ""gamification"" with the other game practices. Different aspects of the gamification concept development in higher education are analyzed and summarized. The effectiveness of gamification as a new way of organizing training and teaching in comparison with traditional technologies is substantiated. The advantages of gamification include: high motivation for student participation in the educational process; increasing of group and individual independent work; maximizing of practical orientation in educational activities to solve professional problems; simulation of students' future professional activities, etc. The authors describe the most popular means of gamification and gaming technology. The possibilities of gamification of Learning Management Systems and Learning Content Management Systems are examined. According to gamification forums on the Internet, the most popular Learning Management Systems platforms are Moodle (https://moodle.org/), Schoology (https://www.schoology.com), ClassDojo (https://www.classdojo.com) and Edmodo (https://www.edmodo.com). The authors illustrate realization of training process with application of gamification elements on the basis of Learning Management System Moodle on examples of personal experience. Complex methodology is applied as a means of identifying, assessing and analyzing. To retrieve primary studies as comprehensively as possible, we deployed a search strategy to find publications systematically. As ontologies are the primary concern, the search focuses on papers that develop ontologies for 'gamification'. © 2020, National Defence University - Carol I Printing House.

With that in mind, we created a staff development session that involved a playful learning activity, in which attendees experienced 90’s nostalgia, whilst working on an important learning and teaching issue. Based on the British game show, The Crystal Maze, The ‘Crys-TEL’ maze required attendees to complete a number of challenges as a group to attempt to ‘solve’ a pressing learning and teaching issue. Using gamification techniques, defined as game design elements in non-game settings, attendees experienced different delivery styles, whilst always working towards the learning and teaching issue they had been asked to consider. In a nod to the original Crystal Maze game show, attendees worked in groups to score points for completing various tasks. The two groups with the most points competed against each other in the final to collect crystals, and ultimately conquer the ’maze’. This article will describe the journey we took from the initial concept through to the delivery of the session, and our reflections and proposed future developments of the Crys-TEL Maze. © 2018 T.

The investigation was conducted over two years, starting with a pilot model applied to a total of 80 students belonging to three different groups, using a gamification model with more than 30 activities (missions) built using Rezzly. The student performance results in gamified activities, and the opinion survey conducted at the end of the semester showed a wide acceptance of the model (more than 50%). Consequently, the gamification model was redesigned, based on the Octalysis framework proposed by Yu-Kai Chou, and constructed using Google Classroom for its implementation during the August-December 2019 semester. The final model included 45 gamified activities implemented for 650 students in 20 groups (classes) in four science subjects, namely, Energy and Transformation (17), Matter and the Environment (1), Fundamentals of Life (1), and Physics for the IB Diploma (1). The following statistics indicate the success of the model and the feasibility of using gamification to motivate and engage students and improve their academic development: a) in total, the students performed 21,673 activities; b) student participation grew from 77.8% in the first period to 83.3% in the final period, and c) the results of the mid and final student opinion surveys indicated that 93.4% of the students would like the model to be replicated in other classes, and 77% of the students considered that the activities helped ""pretty much"" in their learning process. Based on these results, we propose this successful gamification model, which can be adapted and implemented in other subjects, and we provide the evidence of the most significant gamification elements, as specified by the high school students in the research. Also, this work can be used to create a free-access gamification model for science subjects. © ECGBL 2020.All right reserved.",Educational innovation; Gamification in education; Gamification models; Highschool science; Octalysis,Gamification; Students; Surveys; High school; High school students; Learning process; Opinion surveys; Science course; State of Mexico; Student participation; Student performance; Learning systems,,,,,,,"Ahmed A., Sutton M.

The decrease in attendance and difficulties in stimulating students' activity makes it necessary to find new methodologies that can solve these problems. The use of game mechanics in non-ludic environments (Gamification) has begun to be of great interest in research, since it could increase the motivation and therefore the activity of the students. This study tries to verify if there is an existing relationship between gamification and a possible increase in student activity or between the cessation of gamification and student activity. In addition, it evaluates whether a greater student activity corresponds to a greater learning improvement. In the obtained results, no significant differences were found between the methodology or the activity with a learning improvement. According to the study, the simple use of gamified elements does not necessarily imply a solution to the problems posed. The students' activity in a course of these characteristics does not imply a better learning improvement, the importance lies in the quality of the activity generated and not in the quantity. © 2013 IEEE.",gamification; higher education; Student activity,Gamification; Learning systems; Motivation; Computer science students; Learning process; Students,,,,,"LASIGE, (UIDB/00408/2020, UIDP/00408/2020); Madrid Regional Government, (P2018/TCS-4307); Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad, MINECO, (TIN2015-66731-C2-1-R); Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, URJC, (30VCPIGI15); European Regional Development Fund, ERDF","This work was supported in part by the Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad under Grant TIN2015-66731-C2-1-R, in part by Rey Juan Carlos University under Grant 30VCPIGI15, in part by the LASIGE Research Unit under Grant UIDB/00408/2020 and Grant UIDP/00408/2020, in part by the Madrid Regional Government, through the project e-Madrid-CM, under Grant P2018/TCS-4307, and in part by the Structural Funds (FSE and FEDER).","Massingham P., Herrington T., Does attendance matter?

Previous studies have explored online education of health professionals in Second Life (SL), the most widely used virtual world, but none of the previous learning experiences were related to radiology. The purpose of this study was to explore the potential use of SL for undergraduate radiology education and the involvement of students in SL learning activities. Materials and Methods: We delivered a 4-week voluntary undergraduate radiology education program in SL, based on synchronous sessions and asynchronous tasks, with two modalities: introduction to basic radiology for first-cycle (first- to third-year) students and case-based clinical radiology for second-cycle (fourth- to sixth-year) students. Participants completed an evaluation questionnaire about the experiences after the learning program. Results: Forty-six students (20 first-cycle and 26 second-cycle) participated in this study. They found the contents of the course appropriate (mean ≥ 4.53/5), the initiative interesting, and the environment attractive (mean ≥ 4.32/5), and they were willing to participate in future SL experiences (mean ≥ 4.63/5). All students highly rated the organization, the content, the benefit to their medical education, and the professor (mean ≥ 9.05/10). Conclusion: Online radiology education using SL is feasible and well received by medical students of all year groups. The students participated and engaged in this activity very positively and rated the experience highly. The potential of using SL for radiology education includes promising expectations regarding collaborative learning and gamification. © 2018 The Association of University Radiologists",e-Learning; Education; radiology; undergraduate medical education; virtual worlds,"Attitude of Health Personnel; Curriculum; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Humans; Learning; Radiology; Students, Medical; Surveys and Questionnaires; Virtual Reality; collaborative learning; course content; course evaluation; experiential learning; exploratory research; feasibility study; futurology; health care organization; human; learning environment; medical education; medical school; medical student; Note; outcome of education; personal experience; priority journal; questionnaire; radiology; social participation; teacher; undergraduate student; virtual reality; curriculum; education; health personnel attitude; learning; medical education; procedures; radiology",,,,,"Universidad de Málaga, UMA, (PIE10-128)",Funding: This work was supported by the University of Malaga (Innovative Education Project PIE10-128 ). ,"Mahaley S., Teigland R., Advancing learning through virtual worlds, Handbook of research on Web 2.0, 3.0, and x.0: technologies, business, and social applications.

This challenge increases when the teaching and learning process is related to the learning of a second language, due to the absence of educational resources available in any educative institute and the lack of knowledge of appropriate methodologies and didactic strategies to develop the different English linguistic skills (listening, speaking, reading and writing). According to this problem, the present research is proposed by a new methodology strategy, based on the usage of a meaningful learning and the emerging technologies to lead and encourage visual impaired students to learn the English language process, thus, a route map of an educational innovation is presented for teachers who run into visual impairment students in heterogeneous classroom environment, this will stablish a holistic communication allowing an active and students' autonomous participation. © 2019 IEEE.",mobile learning; education 4.0; educational informatics; visual disability; emerging technologies; gamification.,Computer aided instruction; Information systems; Information use; Learning systems; Ophthalmology; Students; Teaching; Classroom environment; Educational innovations; Educational resource; Emerging technologies; English languages; Learning environments; Teaching and learning; Visual impairment; Visual languages,,,,,,,"Piper B., Bulat J., Kwayumba D., Oketch J., Gangla L., Measuring literacy outcomes for the blind and for the deaf : Nationally representative results from Kenya, Int.

To this end, a gamification proposal based on Game of Thrones TV series was designed. Classcraft, an online role-playing platform, was used to create a gaming scenario in the classroom. The proposal was implemented in two groups of 4th year of secondary school, formed by 43 students aged between 15 and 16 years old. Results showed that gamification had a positive impact on fostering students’ motivation. Particularly, a notable increase in students’ participation was observed since their extrinsic and intrinsic motivation – which increased 0.69 and 0.58 points accordingly – had improved after the implementation of the gamification proposal. Consequently, Classcraft proved to be a tool with a great potential to involve and engage students in the EFL classroom. © 2020. Teaching English with Technology.

To describe and evaluate the impact of a competition on investment financial acumen, and its relationship with improved health care industry knowledge. Methods. Students’ confidence on 19 specific areas was assessed by a survey before and after participation in the health care investment competition. Their performance was also compared to that of Standard & Poor’s 500 Index for Healthcare. Results. Students’ self-perception on their knowledge of all 19 domains significantly increased after they participated in the health care investment competition. The average score to questions increased from 1.9 to 3.8. Thirty-eight percent of the students who participated in the competition outperformed Standard & Poor’s 500 Index for Healthcare in the duration of the competition. Conclusion. Students at the University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy designed and implemented a novel way to teach students and faculty members about the business side of health care. The competition took the form of a competitive “mock stock market” style game and resulted in a marked increase in confidence in all observed areas. This increased confidence relates to the students’ increased knowledge in how the health care industry works from a business perspective. © 2018, American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy.

RERCs customarily convene an SOS conference toward the end of their five-year funding cycle in order to assess the current state and identify potential future research, development, and knowledge translation efforts needed to advance their field. The first two sessions focused on the current and future state of information and communication technology (ICT) for mobile health (mHealth) and mobile rehabilitation (mRehab). The third session was a wide‐ranging discussion of pressing needs for future research and development in the field. Several “big ideas” resulted from the discussion among participants in the SOS Conference that should inform the structure and operation of future efforts, including: (1) identifying active ingredients of interventions, (2) incorporating effective behavior‐change techniques into all interventions, (3) including measures of social determinants of health in evaluation studies, (4) incorporating user‐customizable features into technology solutions, and (5) ensuring “discoverability” of research and development outputs by stakeholders via structured and continuous outreach, education and training. Substantive areas of work include gaming and esports, the gamification of interventions for health and fitness, the cultivation of community supports, and continuous outreach and education wherever a person with a disability may live. © 2019 by the authors.

So, this work guide a simple process to implement gamification in classroom environments and evaluate the results of implementation using self-reported from students who are assigned to be game conductors and game participants. The results from an experimental study show the increase of students’ perceived usefulness (understanding, problem solving skills, creativity, and topic interests) and their engagement intention (game engagement intention, class attendance intention, and class participation intention) after conducting or joining in-class games. Guidance to easily implement gameful experiences for students could be applied from an example in this study. © Designing Digitalization, ISD 2018.

Netland (2013), based on a study of production systems in 30 firms, considered that all production systems share the same principles and that these are similar to the Lean system's principles. From its beginnings, the Lean system has evolved and spread to all sectors, and, although it is not the objective of this contribution to explain the scope of Lean, we can confirm that the literature still has no agreed definition of Lean production and, in some way, the general purpose formulations of the concept diverge. However, it is clear that the roots of Lean production should be acquired by future engineers for them to become Lean Thinkers. Understanding and assimilating these concepts on the theoretical level can be complex and so adequate tools need to be employed. We aimed to do this through gamification with LEGO.&copy; Set.Gamification has evolved from activity based learning and is an innovative learning system designed to improve knowledge through experience. It is the process of adding games or game-like elements to something (such as a task) to encourage participation. The Lean Management concepts we worked with were (1) Production based on takt time, (2) Process synchronization, (3) Small lot production, (4) Waste elimination, (5) Setup time reduction, (6) Lead time reduction (7) Cross training, (8) Employee involvement, (9) 5S, (10) Standardized work, (11) Visual control and Management and (12) Supplier involvement. The experience consisted of building a small LEGO ©structure and designing a balanced production line. The main aim was for students to acquire knowledge from the experience by highlighting ways to improve the production system and avoid waste through better planning and by applying some Lean practices. The experience was a complete success in terms of student involvement, and enjoyed satisfactory results in terms of Lean concept acquisition. In Conclusions, we categorize which Lean concepts were more easily consolidated through the game and propose improvements for subsequent experiences. Although the students acquired high levels of the abovementioned concepts, there were four concepts that did not meet the learning objective: Production based on takt time, Small lot production, Setup time reduction and Cross training. The problem was students did not have a standard framework within which to solve the case and, while proposing the concept of creating an innovative production system was solid, the lack of a standard framework made it difficult to compare the different solutions presented by the students. We hope this teaching experience will encourage Production and Operation management lecturers to adapt their lessons to this fascinating new way of teaching management concepts.",Education; Gamification; Lean; LEGO©; Production systems,,,,,,,,"Barragan A.J., Et al., Actas de Las XXXVI Jornadas de Automática, (2015); Cortizo P., Et al., Gamificación y docencia: Lo que la universidad tiene que aprender de los videojuegos, VIII Jornadas Internacionales de Innovación Universitaria, (2011); Fernandez I., Juego Serio: Gamificación y Aprendizaje Comunicación y Pedagogía 281-282, (2015); Hines P., Et al., Learning to evolve: A review of contemporary lean thinking, International Journal of Operations & Production Management, (2004); (2017); Marti-Parreno J., Et al., El uso de la gamificación en la educación superior, XII Jornadas Internacionales de Innovación Universitaria, (2015); Netland T., Exploring the phenomenon of company-specific production systems: One best-way or own best-way?, International Journal of Production Research, (2013); Pettersen J., Defining lean production: Some conceptual and practical issues, The TQM Journal, (2009); Prieto Martin A., Et al., Experiencias de aplicación de estrategias de gamificación a entornos de aprendizaje universitario, ReVision, 7, 2, pp. 76-92, (2014); Voss C.A., Paradigms of manufacturing strategy re-visited, International Journal of Operations & Production Management, (2005); Werbach K., Hunter D., The Gamification Toolkit: Dynamics, Mechanics, and Components for the Win, (2015); Zichermann G., Linder J., The Gamification Revolution: How Leaders Leverage Game Mechanics to Crush the Competition, (2013)",,,Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,,,,,,1132175X,,,,Spanish,Dir.

As a result of this activity, the student should be motivated for learning the specific academic content, becoming a player rather than a spectator in an increasing creativity environment. This work presents a gamification experience within prospective primary teachers in a General Science Classroom. A scoring game-based methodology was used for teaching Matter and Energy contents. In an effort for promoting collaborative dynamics rather than competitive ones in the entire group, a new variable was introduced once the game was started. It was called Game-Index and took into account the scoring of the whole class, similarly to H-Index. The results evidenced the need for these correcting measures in the gamifications processes, since a positive correlation amongst scoring and academic marks was confirmed, but also some kind of competitive-by segreggation inside the class group. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Collaborative work; Gamifying; H-Index; University Science Education,,,,,,,,"Bicen H., Kocakoyun S., Determination of university students’ most preferred mobile application for gamification, World Journal on Educational Technology: Current Issues, 9, 1, pp. 18-23, (2017); Buckley P., Doyle E., Gamification and student motivation, Interactive Learning Environments, 22, 6, pp. 1-15, (2014); Davila-Acedo M.A., Borrachero Cortes A.B., Canada Canada F., Martnez Borreguero M.G., Sanchez-Martin J., Evolution of the emotions experienced by prospective primary teachers, focused on didactics of matter and energy, EUREKA Journal of Science Teaching and Divulgation, 12, 3, pp. 550-564, (2015); de Marcos L., Dominguez A., Saenz-de Navarrete J., Pages C., An empirical study comparing gamification and social networking on e-learning, Computers and Education, 75, 1, pp. 82-91, (2014); de Sousa S., Durelli V.H., Macedo H., Isotani S., A systematic mapping on gamification applied to education ACM, Proceedings of the 29th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing, New York, (2014); Dominguez A., Saenz-de Navarrete J., de Marcos L., Fernandez-Sanz L., Pages C., Martinez-Herraiz J.-J., Gamifying learning experience: Practical implications and outcomes, Computers and Education, 63, 1, pp. 380-392, (2013); Fink E., Play as a symbol of the world and other writings, (2016); Fleischmann K., Ariel E., Gamification in science education: Gamifying learning of microscopic preprocess in the laboratory, Contemporary Educational Technology, 7, 2, pp. 138-159, (2016); Fried R.L., The passionate teacher.

Owing to the fact that the group of students chosen for the study consisted of pre-service grade school teachers, their opinions on the use of the Wiki environment along with its embedded gamification elements in their future careers have been sought. Of particular interest were the considerations of pre-service teachers concerning the age levels of a target audience that they believed would benefit from instruction with this particular educational tool. Following a mixed-research methodological pattern, the study was conducted in two consecutive stages. The first stage involved a quasi-experiment and the second was handled as a case study. In order to examine the long-term effects of Wiki activities supported by gamification elements on student academic success, a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical test was conducted based on scores from an initial pre-knowledge test, an applied interim examination, and a final examination. In order to determine the opinions of teacher candidates regarding Wiki activities and the process of gamification, results from an open-ended questionnaire were consulted. It was eventually discovered that students in both the Wiki-only (p = 0.02) and gamified-Wiki (p = 0.00) activity groups displayed significantly greater academic success compared to a control group. Although gamification elements also caused a significant difference between the two Wiki groups in terms of the number of times content is displayed (1670 > 637) and edited (38 > 18), it was observed that participation rates fell over time in both groups. As for academic success, there was no difference between the two Wiki groups (p = 0.92). It was found that teacher candidates regard Wiki and gamification activities positively. Also, it was noted that they did not possess an adequate level of consciousness of the fact that student capabilities are an important factor in making effective use of technology. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Gamification; Integration of technology in education; Web 2.0; Wiki,Analysis of variance (ANOVA); Gamification; Teaching; Educational activities; Level of consciousness; Methodological patterns; Open-ended questionnaire; Technology in educations; Undergraduate students; Web 2.0; Wiki; Students,,,,,,,"Archer J., Lammin A., An investigation of personal and academic stressors college Campuses, J.

It may seem easy, but teaching inspiring lessons which join content, creativity, time management, and good dynamics is not an easy task, especially when introducing a gamification activity. Observing this scenario, in the course of Logistic Distribution, classes using gamification were introduced. This research presented a case study. The research had a qualitative and quantitative approach. This case allows the deepening of knowledge and brings new dynamics to the classroom. Based on the concept of gamification it is possible to apply the subjects studied in academic activities in the areas of Administration, Logistic, Economics, Accounting Sciences, Psychology, Human Resources Management, Foreign Trade and the various engineering areas. The gamification also makes possible a collaborative approach and the use of technology in Education. The use of technologies within gamification will make the game even more attractive. The result was very positive because the students were able to understand that it is possible to associate theory and practice in a pleasurable activity. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.",Gamification; Higher education; Lego,International trade; Teaching; Collaborative approach; Gamification; Higher education; Human resources management; Lego; Logistic distributions; Qualitative and quantitative approaches; Technology in educations; Students,,,,,,,"Zichermann G., Cunningham C., Gamification by Design: Implementing Game Mechanics in Web and Mobile Apps, O’Reilly Media, Sebastopol, (2011); Johnson L., Adams Becker S., Cummins M., Estrada V., Freeman A., Hall C., NMC Horizon Report: 2016 Higher, (2016); Pimenta S.G., Anastasiou L.G.C., Docência No Ensino Superior, (2002); McConigal J., A Realidade Em Jogo-Por Que Os Games Nos Tornam Melhores E Como Eles Podem Mudar O Mundo, (2012); Schmitz B., Klemke R., Specht M., Effects of mobile gaming patterns on learning outcomes: A literature review, J.

The structure of gamification is composed of dynamics, mechanisms and components. When the gamification is considered as a pyramid, the components are at the base of this pyramid. One of the most effective gamification components is digital badges. Digital badges can be viewed as a tool that reflects the diverse capabilities of learners. The purpose of this research is to examine the views of teachers on the use of digital badges in educational environments. The research was conducted with 15 teachers in different branches working in the same educational institution. In the study, data were gathered by structured interview form. Collected Data were analyzed using content analysis methods. As a result of the analyzes made, it is seen that teachers generally have favorable opinions about the use of digital badges in educational environments. As a result of the research, it was seen that the use of digital badge has some advantages such as giving positive behavior to the students, motivation towards the lesson, active participation and interest in the lesson. It also appears to have some disadvantages such as competition among students and infrastructure problems. In addition, a large number of participants have stated that use of digital badges with some changes would be used widely in learning environments. © Karadeniz Technical University.

In this paper, we present a study to determine the best gamification mechanics suitable for Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) learning since various TVET providers’ lack of competencies in identifying and significant applicable and current vocational pedagogic competence for Twenty Fist Century TVET. Gamification is the integration of game-like design elements into non-game context to engage learners as well as function as entertainment that cause learners to enjoy actively participating and engaging with others, such as through reputation points, rewards and goal setting. In tertiary education, researchers and practitioners have been search for effective techniques to improve student engagement and stimulate learning. The study involved 36 students from TVET Public University (Level 6) and 34 students from TVET Community College (Level 3) as a sample. The results revealed that for TVET Level 6 learner’s preferred Learner–Content interaction (0.4488) while TVET Level 3 learners preferred Learner–Instructor interaction (0.4652). The best six of gamification mechanic for each gamification interaction criterion were selected based on the highest weight for each criterion. For Group 1 which is Rewards (0.4135), Skill Points (0.3279), Trophies-Badges (0.3101), Wally Games (0.3021), Progress Bar (0.2765) and Virtual Goods (0.2587). While for Group 2 are Rewards (0.5779), Memory Game (0.4454), Team Leader Board (0.2508), Redeemable Point (0.2440), Progress Bar (0.2329) and Peer Emotion Feedback (0.2074). © 2017 American Scientific Publishers.

The tool aims at the analysis of demand in educational facilities and the optimization of their location and capacities. It was developed for the use case of Berlin using only publicly available resources and data sets. Through preprocessed GIS-and statistical data plus an easy-access interface, the tool encourages people from different backgrounds and even those with no professional knowledge in planning, to engage in urban decision making. Although being initially aimed at contributing to a moderated participation process, the tool's simple GUI (graphical user interface) and open source backend, make it usable in any setup-without a briefed advisor or the need for later professional evaluation by another party. © 2018, Education and research in Computer Aided Architectural Design in Europe.

Game developers and companies are using gamification tools and the knowledge about player types and their characteristics, to successfully affect the behaviour of their players or customers. The success of apps like “Adidas Running” and “Pokemon Go” (Niantic) and their millions of constant players tell us, that gamification can work. But the potential of gamification goes beyond selling healthy lifestyles or marketing strategies, it also finds its way into the educational system. The paper takes a closer look at definitions of gamification and different player types. Furthermore, it investigates the topic in an educational context where the authors concentrate on motivational aspects of learning environments as well as downsides and risks of gamification. In a pilot study in two classes at a secondary school, the authors investigated different gamification tools to motivate students to increase the participation in class, do more off-school assignments and finally improve their grades.

Qualitative research has been carried out using semi-structured interviews. The participants were 70 teachers from different schools in the province of Seville. The results show the similarities and differences that exist between the three educational stages in terms of the methodological strategies used to facilitate learning and participation of all students. The strategies used by these teachers are explained, as well as what they do and how they use them. Specifically, this study analyses seven methodological strategies: project-based learning, cooperative learning, peer tutoring, dialogical learning, play and gamification, interactive groups, learning corners, experiential learning and service-learning. The conclusions reveal that the inclusive methodological strategies are an opportunity for other teachers to benefit themselves, improve their own practice and learning from other educational stages. © 2020 Manuscript Studies.

One of the advantages of using gamification is that motivates students to investigate and design strategies in order to achieve a better performance in the game. There are many studies that highlight the different benefits of using gamification in the classroom, among some of these benefits gamification improves student participation, motivation and commitment, encourages more collaboration between students, increases content understanding, among others. On the other hand, it is necessary to understand that the paradigm of employers has changed. Companies today need more flexible people, with different skills, with the ability to ""learn to learn"". This skill is essential to cope with the complexity of interactions that people frequently face. This is why many companies prefer to have employees who manage their time and achieve results independently (without the direction of supervisors, trainers, or educators). Day by day it is more important that people develop the ability to acquire new skills, new knowledge and self-management. For the past two years, with other colleagues in the logistics area at our university, we have worked on designing a course based on an online game called Logistic Simulator (or LOST, for short). The intention of the game is that students can acquire knowledge in an easy and fun way. To improve their performance in the game, they must investigate and learn different topics of the course on their own, and even investigate content that is not found within the syllabus. This study aims to point out how gamification influences the student's perception of self-directed learning. The study shows that students significantly change their perception of some of the areas related to their participation and the degree of responsibility they have for their own learning, in particular, students improve their abilities in the search for information, autonomy and self-management. © ECGBL 2020.All right reserved.",Educational Innovation; Game based learning; Gamification; Higher Education; Self-Directed Learning; Serious Games,Curricula; Gamification; Learning systems; Design strategies; Educational environment; Learning process; Learning techniques; Logistic simulators; Self management; Self-directed learning; Student participation; Students,,,,,TecLabs; Tecnologico de Monterrey,"Funding text 1: The authors would like to acknowledge the financial and the technical support of Writing Lab, TecLabs, Tecnologico de Monterrey in the production of this work.; Funding text 2: The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support of Novus Grant with PEP no.

Interventions that promote healthy sleep, such as those that focus on the dissemination of behavioral and environmental recommendations of sleep hygiene with children, are presented as an alternative. Serious game design offers wide-reaching domains in health applications and is increasing in popularity, particularly with children and teens because of it's potential to engage and motivate players differently from other interventions. This study aims to evaluate effects of serious game on sleep hygiene recommendations ""Perfect Bedroom: learn to sleep well,"" on sleep habits and sleep parameters of healthy children. This is an experimental, prospective and quantitative study. We will randomize children in experimental (n = 88) and no intervention groups (n = 88). The experiment has four stages (pre-intervention, intervention, post-intervention, and follow-up), which will count with participation of children and their parents/guardians. In the evaluation stages, the guardians will answer questionnaires and scales to assess sociodemographic and health data, sleep habits and sleep pattern of their child. The children themselves will answer the following: a scale to assess sleepiness levels, a questionnaire to evaluate the serious game and the game itself, will characterize their bedroom and the activities they perform before sleep, with strategies developed by researches. Intervention with experimental group conducted with the serious game ""Perfect Bedroom"" will happen twice a week, for 3 weeks in a row, resulting in six sessions of 50 min each. Inferential analysis will be conducted for comparisons between groups and intragroups to measure effect of intervention in primary outcomes (sleep habits) and secondary outcomes (sleep parameters). We expect that the intervention with this game can provide valuable evidence to a new approach in promoting healthy sleep habits, with applications in clinical, educational, and familiar settings, which could diminish future health issues and risk at psychiatric diseases, decreasing the social burden of treatments for these conditions in children. © 2018 Almondes and Leonardo.",Children; Gamification; Health education; Interactive learning; Serious game; Sleep; Sleep hygiene; Sleep quality,,,,,,,,"Allen S.L., Howlett M.D., Coulombe J.A., Corkum P.V., ABCs of SLEEPING: a review of the evidence behind pediatric sleep practice recommendations, Sleep Med.

Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the implementation of a mental gamification from blended learning based on the flex model and efficacy of this program on students. METHODS: In this study, with the design of mental illness lessons for undergraduate and executive groups, using flex model, two parts of technical and educational design were used. In the technical section, three parts on dynamics, mechanisms, and elements of gaming were considered. Intervention was studied on different groups of medical students including medical, health, and laboratory sciences. Effect of this educational program and its impact on their students' learning, motivation, and satisfaction was studied using quantitative and qualitative analyses. RESULTS: The results of the students' prospective about the efficacy of the method showed that the mean scores of most of the items were higher than the average. This implies that students' attitude toward using gamification was positive. In the other part, the qualitative results of the study were analyzed and the students' analysis of their advantages and disadvantages and their perceptions on the impact of the intervention was examined. CONCLUSION: Based on the flex model, mental gamification based on blended learning is effective in shaping the students' satisfaction. © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

This paper presents how education innovation can help students to improve their learning and understanding of the different concepts and thus to get better results in the subject and to achieve the desired outcomes. The Process Control Course is taught in the Bachelor Degree in Chemical Engineering at the Technical University of Madrid. Different methodologies have been integrated and used in the course as: flipped classroom, peer instruction or gamification. In order to implement the mentioned methods, the following material has been developed: screencasts, concept tests, trivia contest and simulations besides the traditional lecturing material (slides and text). First year results show high student motivation, higher participation in class and better results (marks) in the subject. © 2018 Institution of Chemical Engineers",Active learning; adaptive learning; flipped classroom; gamification; peer instruction; peer learning,Artificial intelligence; Teaching; Active Learning; Adaptive learning; Flipped classrooms; Gamification; Peer instruction; Peer learning; Process control,,,,,,,"Bishop J.L., Verleger M., The flipped classroom: A survey of the research, 120th ASEE Annual Conference, American Society for Engineering Education, Atlanta, (2013); Barna B., Fodor S., An empirical study on the use of gamification on it courses at higher education, Teaching and Learning in a Digital World.

Despite that, it is not a subject that students are motivated to learn. Gamification is a promising way to address issues in software testing education; it is used to insert game elements in educational contexts aiming to increase students’ motivation and performance. Objective: Reporting on results of an experimental study designed to assess the impact of gamification on software testing education. Method: We carried out the experimental sessions with undergraduate students from three Brazilian institutions. They have been taught basic testing concepts and functional testing. Moreover, the experimental group used a gamified platform that included 10 game elements to increase students’ motivation and performance, attract their attention, and instigate their participation, collaboration, and competitiveness. Results: The experimental group was more motivated than the control group. Regarding performance, the experimental group had an equivalent performance compared to the control group in the pre- and post- tests. However, we observed a trend for the control group to reach a higher performance, as the results from the quiz activities showed significant difference. Conclusion: Although several studies concluded that gamification has the potential to lead to positive outcomes, we reached both positive and negative results. So that, we present our findings and answer whether, in our point of view, it is worth using gamification on software testing education. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Education, gamification; Experience report; Game elements; Quality assurance; Software testing",Computer software selection and evaluation; Gamification; Motivation; Quality assurance; Students; Educational context; Experience report; Experimental groups; Functional testing; Game elements; Motivation and performance; Quality of softwares; Undergraduate students; Software testing,,,,,"Federal University of S?o Carlos; Federal University of São Carlos; State of S?o Paulo Research Foundation; Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, FAPESP, (2013/07375-0, 2017/10941-8); Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq, (167513/2017-6, 306310/2016-3, 312922/2018-3)","Funding text 1: This work was financed by CNPq (grants #167513/2017-6, #306310/2016-3, and #312922/2018-3), State of São Paulo Research Foundation - FAPESP (grants #2017/10941-8 and #2013/07375-0), Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pes-soal de Nível Superior - Brasil (CAPES) - Finance Code 001, and Federal University of São Carlos.; Funding text 2: This work was financed by CNPq (grants #167513/2017-6, #306310/2016-3, and #312922/2018-3), State of S?o Paulo Research Foundation - FAPESP (grants #2017/10941-8 and #2013/07375-0), Coordena??o de Aperfei?oamento de Pessoal de N?vel Superior - Brasil (CAPES) - Finance Code 001, and Federal University of S?o Carlos.","Anderson P.E., Et al., Facilitating programming success in data science courses through gamified scaffolding and learn2mine, ITiCSE’15, (2015); Bartle R., Hearts, clubs, diamonds, spades: Players who suit muds, Journal of MUD Research, (1996); Bell J., Et al., Secret ninja testing with halo software engineering, SSE’11, (2011); Benitti F.B.V., As a teacher, I want to know what to teach in requirements engineering so that professionals can be better prepared, SBES’17, (2017); Cheiran J.F.P., Et al., Problem-based learning to align theory and practice in software testing teaching, SBES’17, (2017); Clegg B.S., Et al., Teaching software testing concepts using a mutation testing game, ICSE’17 Education Track, (2017); Dal Sasso T., Et al., How to gamify software engineering, SANER’17, (2017); Deci E.L., Ryan R.M., Levels of analysis, regnant causes of behavior and well-being: The role of psychological needs, Psychological Inquiry, 22, (2011); Deterding S., Et al., From game design elements to game-fulness: Defining ""gamification, MindTrek’11, (2011); Dubois D.J., Tamburrelli G., Understanding gamification mechanisms for software development, ESEC/FSE’13, (2013); Garcia F., Et al., A framework for gamification in software engineering, Journal of Systems and Software, 132, (2017); Jesus G.M., Et al., Gamification in software testing: A characterization study, SAST’18, (2018); Lyra K.T., Et al., Infographics or graphics+text: Which material is best for robust learning?, ICALT’16, (2016); Myers G.J., Et al., The Art of Software Testing, (2011); Paschoal L.N., Et al., Abordagem Flipped Classroom em Comparação com o Modelo Tradicional de Ensino: Uma Investigação Empírica no Âmbito de Teste de Software, SBIE 2017, (2017); Pedro L.Z., Uso De Gamificação Em Ambientes Virtuais De Aprendizagem Para Reduzir O Problema Da Externalização De Comportamentos Indesejáveis, (2016); Pinto F.S., Silva P.C., Gamification applied for software engineering teaching-learning process, SBES’17, (2017); Rojas J.M., Fraser G., Code defenders: A mutation testing game, Mutation’16, (2016); Rojas J.M., Fraser G., Teaching mutation testing using gamification, ECSEE’16, (2016); Shepard T., Et al., More testing should be taught, Commun.

But it still pays little attention to using gamification in Adult learning activities. Through a systematic literature review, this study investigates the literature on the motivational and behavioral theories underlying gamification in the context of learning to synthesize the essential factors to improve learning outcomes. This paper presents a conceptual model of gamification in a learning context. A theory-driven model was created in order to categorize into a multi-dimensional model. In addition, this model can be extended to any kind of games not only educational games because the whole gaming experience is based on the same theory as human learning. It originates from behavioral science and it has progressed well-stablished learning algorithm. By investigating and synthesizing the earlier studies and categorizing them in accordance with a contemporary approach, a conceptual model for gamification of adult learning has been proposed. Then in order to validate and test this theory-driven model should be implemented and tested in experimental studies involving organization employees. © 2019 IEEE.",e-learning; education; game elements; gameful design; gamification; gamified learning; learning,Behavioral research; E-learning; Education; Engineering research; Knowledge based systems; Learning algorithms; Game elements; Gameful designs; Gamification; gamified learning; learning; Learning systems,,,,,,,"Prensky M., Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants Part 1. on the Horizon, 9, 5, pp. 1-6, (2001); McGonigal J., Reality is broken: Why games make us better and how they can change the world, Penguin, (2011); Deterding S., Dixon D., Khaled R., Nacke L., From Game Design Elements to Gamefulness: Defining, Gamification MindTrek'11 Proceedings of the 15th International Academic MindTrek Conference: Envisioning Future Media Environments, pp. 9-15, (2011); Zichermann G., Cunningham C., Gamification by Design: Implementing Game Mechanics in Web and Moblie Apps, (2011); Csikszentmihalyi M., Attention and the holistic approach to behavior, The Stream of Consciousness, pp. 335-358, (1978); Nakamura J., Csikszentmihalyi M., Flow theory and research, Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology, pp. 195-206, (2009); Shernoff D.J., Csikszentmihalyi M., Schneider B., Shernoff E.S., Student engagement in high school classrooms from the perspective of flow theory, School Psychology Quarterly, 18, 2, pp. 158-176, (2003); Deci E.L., Ryan R.M., The general causality orientations scale: Self-determination in personality, Journal of Research in Personality, 19, pp. 109-134, (1985); Ryan R., Deci E., Intrinsic and extrinsic motivations: Classic definitions and new directions, Contemporary Educational Psychology, 25, 1, pp. 54-67, (2000); Kumar J., Herger M., Gamification at work: Designing engaging business software, Interaction Design Foundation, (2013); Festinger L., A theory of social comparison processes, Human Relations, 7, pp. 117-140, (1954); Hamari J., Do badges increase user activity?

Based on the proposed model, we detail the design of a technology-enhanced learning experience in which a series of traditional lessons are enriched by collaborative work on interactive tabletops; four gameful activities are used which may be directly linked to a school curriculum. We conduct a qualitative case study with the participation of 86 fifth grade students across two elementary schools which have a significant minority enrolment. We demonstrate the ways in which the students draw on recently-acquired knowledge, engage in dramatic play, share the digital space and collaborate intensively to achieve a new and refined understanding of concepts and behaviours linked to perspective-taking. We discuss how tabletops, in synergy with constructivist pedagogy and principles of gameful design, allow researchers and practitioners to promote communication, collaboration and perspective-taking in ways that were hitherto difficult to enact in traditional lessons. Gameful design for learning is seen as a multilevel endeavour, which involves the selection of tasks and tools as well as the behaviour of the learners and the instructor as participants in the learning environment. © 2018, Association for Educational Communications and Technology.",Case-based learning; Gameful design; Gameful learning; Gamification; Interactive tabletops; Perspective-taking; Socio-emotional education; Technology-enhanced learning,,,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020, (692058, H2020-TWINN-2015, YΕ/YΑ/ΤΑΜΕ/02.2015-2016)","Funding Authors acknowledge funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme through the NOTRE Project (H2020-TWINN-2015, Grant Agreement Number: 692058) as well as funding from Project (YΕ/YΑ/ΤΑΜΕ/02.2015-2016) awarded to the Limassol municipality and other local authorities in Cyprus.","Antoniou C., Ioannou A., Technology for social change in school contexts: A new landscape for K-12 educational technology research, Education and Information Technologies:, (2018); Ardito C., Buono P., Costabile M.F., Lanzilotti R., Piccinno A., End users as co-designers of their own tools and products, Journal of Visual Languages & Computing, 23, 2, pp. 78-90, (2012); Ardito C., Lanzilotti R., Costabile M.F., Desolda G., Integrating traditional learning and games on large displays: An experimental study, Journal of Educational Technology & Society, 16, pp. 44-56, (2013); Basheri M., Burd L., Munro M., Baghaei N., Collaborative Learning Skills in Multi-touch Tables for UML Software Design, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 4, 3, (2013); Bruun A., Jensen K.E., Kristensen D.H., Kjeldskov J., Escaping the trough: Towards real-world impact of tabletop research, International Journal of Human?

First, we learn about ourselves and the world around us through playing games. As we grow up, learning leaves the form of entertainment, and it gradually takes on the outlines of formal education. Formal education, with its strict, pre-defined rules and goals, leaves no room for individual creativity and play. In such a standardized environment, we often find ourselves demotivated and limited, which can lead us to poor learning outcomes or even to giving up on learning. This issue is more often seen in e-learning systems, which, by its nature, require additional educational measures to compensate physical distance, as well as the diversity of individuals who participate in the process of e-learning. This thesis proposes a model for personalized e-learning environment in which game design principles and game elements are used for the purpose of increasing the participation and engagement of students and, therefore, improving learning outcomes. In order for gamification to be successful different students’ learning characteristic are taken into account. © 2018 CEUR-WS.

This study explores promoting motivation in a distance education, third-year computer programming course via a gamified approach to improve coursework participation and student experience. Motivation was examined from a Self-Determination Theory (SDT) perspective, as gamified approaches often rely on external motivation and the explicit use of competition to engender internal motivation leading to desired behaviours. The results of using gamification in education are mixed, and its use is controversial. Two cycles of action research on the introduction of eight playful elements are reported on, and data relating to student engagement with the course and a student questionnaire was gathered. There was little evidence that the intervention led to behaviour change or improved scores; however, students responded very positively to the intervention, although some negative themes emerged. The extent to which the playful approach supported the basic psychological needs of SDT is discussed and the intervention's results critically considered, including whether the effort involved in such an approach was worth it. It was concluded that such playful approaches might have positive motivational effects. © 2018 Athabasca University.",Distance learning; Gamification; Guided didactic conversation; Motivation; Self-determination theory,,,,,,,,"Abu-Dawood S., The cognitive and social motivational affordances of gamification in e-learning environment, In Proceedings of the IEEE 16th International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies, pp. 373-375, (2016);

The low attendance likely resulted in many first-year students lacking awareness of the services LTS offered and where to ask for assistance regarding the services. The LTS Ramp Up is a modular course built and administered in Moodle that introduces first-year students to the core library and technology services that will support academic success and facilitate a productive scholarly experience. The course features digital badges and prizes to incentivize participation and utilized Panopto to create several closed-captioned instructional video shorts.

This increase in the popularity of digital games is mostly associated not only with the interesting designs of the digital games but also with the emotional satisfaction with these games. In recent years, this tendency towards digital games has led to the transfer of certain features of games to non-game contexts. The concept named gamification refers to the adaptation of game features to non-game contexts. Gamification has been in use in many areas in recent years. One of these areas is the field of education. Therefore, the present study aimed to examine the effectiveness of elements of gamification in blended learning environments within the context of emotion, interest and online participation. In the study, the convergent parallel mixed design, which allowed explaining the quantitative and qualitative data in association with each other, was used. In this respect, the study was carried out with 63 university students (30 students in the experimental group and 33 students in the control group) in a period of 13 weeks. In the research process, the two groups of students were provided with the opportunity to experience the blended learning environment both on face-to-face basis and on online basis. The experimental group differed from the control group in terms of such gamification elements presented in face-to-face and online environments as being given directives, progress bar, badge, level, experience point, leaderboard, award, completion rate, activity completion, activity restriction and activity feedback. According to the data collected in the study, gamification elements used in blended learning environments have caused the participants to develop both positive and negative emotions. In addition, it was revealed that gamification was found interesting by the participants Moreover, it was seen that there was a significant difference between the times spent by the groups in terms of their participation in online environment in favor of the experimental group. In addition, it was found that award, competition, level, badge and restriction were influential on the students' participation in online environment. © 2018 Turkish Education Association.

An empirical-analytical methodology was used and a mixed final questionnaire was carried out. The teaching method was based on the Flipped Classroom (FC) methodology and 10 Kahoot format questions were created. The methodology used in this study was document collection procedures, questionnaire and content analysis. The data showed that 19% of 35 students had more than five hits in Kahoot and most of them attribute the errors to lack of adequate study, difficulty in responding correctly in a short time, and lack of concentration or memory. There was no rejection about the tool, since 66% of the students would recommend its use in higher education. The positive aspects of the Kahoot most cited were its usefulness, the possibility of stimulating and motivating learning by promoting or dynamism, fun, participation and competitiveness in the classes. Promoting new strategies for teaching and learning, seeking to involve and motivate students with methodologies such as Flipped Classroom is highly recommended, as digital natives are no longer satisfied with traditional classes. © 2019 ACM.",Flipped Classroom; Gamification; Higher Education; IRS; Kahoot,Ecosystems; Gamification; Iridium; Surveys; Teaching; Analytical methodology; Classroom methodologies; Document collection; Flipped Classroom; Higher education; Kahoot; Teaching and learning; Undergraduate students; Students,,,,,,,"Moran J., Metodologias ativas e modelos híbridos na educação, Novas Tecnologias Digitais: Reflexões Sobre Mediação, Aprendizagem e Desenvolvimento, (2017); Bhattacharya S., Nath S., Intelligent e-learning systems: An educational paradigm shif, International Journal of Interactive Multimedia and Artificial Intelligence, 4, pp. 83-88, (2016); Verdu E., Regueras L.M., Gal E., Castro De J.P., Verdu M.J., Kohen-Vacs D., Integration of an intelligent tutoring system in a course of computer network design, Educ.

One of the advantages of using gamification is that motivates students to investigate and design strategies in order to achieve a better performance in the game. There are many studies that highlight the different benefits of using gamification in the classroom, among some of these benefits gamification improves student participation, motivation and commitment, encourages more collaboration between students, increases content understanding, among others. On the other hand, it is necessary to understand that the paradigm of employers has changed. Companies today need more flexible people, with different skills, with the ability to ""learn to learn"". This skill is essential to cope with the complexity of interactions that people frequently face. This is why many companies prefer to have employees who manage their time and achieve results independently (without the direction of supervisors, trainers, or educators). Day by day it is more important that people develop the ability to acquire new skills, new knowledge and self-management. For the past two years, with other colleagues in the logistics area at our university, we have worked on designing a course based on an online game called Logistic Simulator (or LOST, for short). The intention of the game is that students can acquire knowledge in an easy and fun way. To improve their performance in the game, they must investigate and learn different topics of the course on their own, and even investigate content that is not found within the syllabus. This study aims to point out how gamification influences the student's perception of self-directed learning. The study shows that students significantly change their perception of some of the areas related to their participation and the degree of responsibility they have for their own learning, in particular, students improve their abilities in the search for information, autonomy and self-management. © 2020 Dechema e.V..

Drive by Self-Determination Theory (SDT), this study believes that motivational affordance resulted from gamification activity may lead to psychological outcome, and this psychological outcome will lead to behavioural outcome. Methodology: The study was conducted using qualitative action research methodology with descriptive analysis in two classes of Enterprise Strategy course. Three phases were involved for data gathering. Main Findings: In phase 1, when traditional lecture was solely used, students seemed to be passive, indifferent and reluctant to participate. In phase 2, when traditional lecture is supplanted with gamification activity, students have participated actively. Similar results of phase 2 was found in phase 3, where different set of students were observed. Students also perceived that using gamification in classroom provide enjoyable and fun environment, attractive and exciting, besides enhancing knowledge. Students also perceived that gamification activity increases participation, improving motivation, creating competition, developing teamwork and bonding between students and instructor and should be conducted more. Application: The results of this study may be beneficial to students in term of new technique used in teaching and learning process through enhancement of knowledge circulation from lecturers to students or between the students themselves. The results may also heighten the awareness of instructors in identifying alternative tools besides conducting traditional lectures. The results also may encourage administrators in helping the instructors towards upgrading their teaching methods and performance using latest applications for the purpose of improving students’ engagement. Novelty/Originality: The findings from study add to the body of knowledge on the significance of using gamification in classroom in order to engage students in classroom activity. © 2019 by authors, all rights reserved.",Dialogue; Educational Conversation; Kindergarten Teacher Education; Professional Mentoring; Subjectification; Succeeding with Studies,,,,,,,,"Nasjonale Retningslinjer for Barnehagelærerutdanningen., (2012); Dysthe O., Sosiokulturelle teoriperspektiv på kunnskap og læring, Dialog, Samspel Og Læring., (2001); Vygotsky L.S., Mind in Society.

In response, teachers are beginning to integrate gamification techniques into their classrooms in order to motivate classroom participation and to conduct learning evaluation. Kahoot is a free, online quiz platform and instant feedback system that helps teachers create a fun competitive-gaming environment. Learners may access the platform using a mobile phone or tablet to answer multiple-choice questions. The platform may be introduced at different stages of learning activities or combined with the flipped classroom model in order to achieve various teaching goals. This article provides a brief introduction of the gamification of learning and then discusses the operational skills needed to use Kahoot and the effectiveness of this platform, including advantages, limitations, and user feedback. Finally, the authors share their Kahoot-related teaching designs and experiences. It is suggested that nurse educators may apply Kahoot in their innovative teaching practices. © 2018 Journal of Management and Business Administration.

Multiple-choice questions were released weekly or biweekly during two rounds of play. Participation was voluntary, and students could play the game using any Web-enabled device. Analyses of data generated from the game included (1) descriptive, (2) logistic regression modeling of factors associated with user attrition, (3) generalized linear mixed model for retention of knowledge, and (4) analysis of variance of final examination performance by play styles. Researchers found a statistically significant increase in the odds of a correct response (odds ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-3.4) for a round 1 question repeated in round 2, suggesting retention of knowledge. They also found statistically significant differences in final examination performance among different play styles. To maximize the benefits of gamification, researchers must use the resulting data both to power educational analytics and to inform nurse educators how to enhance student engagement, knowledge retention, and academic performance. © 2018 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Analytics; Digital data; Gamification; Undergraduate nursing education,"Computer-Assisted Instruction; Education, Nursing, Baccalaureate; Educational Measurement; Games, Experimental; Humans; Learning; Nursing Education Research; Nursing Evaluation Research; Nursing Methodology Research; Software; Students, Nursing; analysis of variance; article; competition; human; human experiment; multiple choice test; nursing education; nursing student; scientist; software; education; game; learning; nursing education; nursing evaluation research; nursing methodology research; procedures; psychology; statistics and numerical data; teaching",,,,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NCATS, (UL1TR001417)","Author Affiliations: Family, Community, and Health Systems (Drs Roche and Azuero) and Acute, Chronic and Continuing Care (Dr Wingo), University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) School of Nursing; Biostatistics, UAB School of Public Health (Mr Westfall); UAB Center for Clinical and Translational Science (Mr Dempsey); and Division of Infectious Diseases, UAB School of Medicine (Dr Willig).

The research on gamification in learning is hindered by the users’ heterogeneity, whose personal and professional traits can moderate the impact of gamification on learning success. This study aims to experimentally investigate the moderator role of learners’ learning tendencies on gamification success concerning students’ academic participation, engagement, and experience. In our study, 85 students were randomly assigned to one control and two treatment groups. Our results showed gamification design positively contributes to the academic participation, affects learners’ engagement in gamified environments, and that students’ engagement was moderated by students’ learning tendencies. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Engagement; Gamification; Gamified experience; Gamified learning theory; Learning tendencies; Personalization,Students; Empirical investigation; Game elements; Learning Theory; Treatment group; Gamification,,,,,,,"Landers R., Developing a theory of gamified learning: Linking serious games and gamification of learning, Simul.

In this demo paper we present the Gamification Design Framework (GDF), a tool for designing gamified applications through model-driven engineering mechanisms. In particular, the framework is based on a set of well-defined modelling layers that start from the definition of the main gamification elements, followed by the specification on how those elements are composed to design games, and then progressively refined to reach concrete game implementation and execution. The layers are interconnected through specialization/generalization relationships such that to realize a multi-level modelling approach. The approach is implemented by means of JetBrains MPS, a language workbench based on projectional editing, and has been validated through two gameful systems in the Education and Mobility domains. A prototype implementation of GDF and related artefacts are available at the demo GitHub repository: https://github.com/antbucc/GDF.git, while an illustrative demo of the framework features and their exploitation for the case studies are shown in the following video: https://youtu.be/wxCe6CTeHXk. © 2019 IEEE.",Gamification Design Framework; JetBrains MPS; Model-Driven Engineering; Multi-Level Modelling,HTTP; Systems analysis; Behavioural changes; Design frameworks; Design games; JetBrains MPS; Language workbenches; Model-driven Engineering; Multilevels; Prototype implementations; C (programming language),,,,,"European Institute of Innovation and Technology, EIT; Metabolic Support UK, CLIMB; Korean Institute of Criminology, KIC",ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was partially funded by the EIT Climate KIC projects CLIMB Ferrara and SMASH.,"Koivisto J., Hamari J., The rise of motivational information systems: A review of gamification research, International Journal of Information Management, 45, pp. 191-210, (2019); Compare 120+ Gamification Platforms, (2019); Csikszentmihalyi M., Selega Csikszentmihalyi I., Optimal Experience: Psychological Studies of Flow in Consciousness, (1992); Pedreira O., Garca F., Brisaboa N., Piattini M., Gamification in software engineering-a systematic mapping, Information and Software Technology, 57, pp. 157-168, (2015); Morschheuser B., Hassan L., Werder K., Hamari J., How to design gamification?

Nine third-through sixth-grade classrooms (n = 292 students) in one elementary-middle school in Detroit, Michigan (49% female, 95% nonwhite; 80% qualified for free/reduced lunch) participated in this 20-week intervention where teachers implemented 5 × 4 min moderate-to-vigorous activity breaks per day. Gamification of activity breaks occurred during weeks 13–20 of the intervention and included the use of game design elements and classroom goals for activity break intensity. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) during activity breaks was measured via direct observation. There was a significant effect of intervention with a 27% increase in student MVPA participation during the gamified intervention weeks compared with the standard intervention weeks (p = 0.03). Gamification of activity breaks resulted in 55% (compared with 25% during the standard intervention) of students accumulating approximately 20 min of health-enhancing physical activity per day in their classroom. These findings provide preliminary evidence that gamifying activity breaks may be an important strategy for increasing student participation in classroom activity breaks. © 2019 by the authors.

These courses implementation suffers common problems related to low student participation, low academic performance, low approval rate and low student satisfaction. The current trends of virtual education are influenced by new strategies such as the use of gamification in the design of virtual content; this is due to the good results it has had on motivation, academic performance and student participation. This document describes the implementation of a strategy of gamification based on role-play in a MOOC course on Prevention of Child Sexual Abuse in the CEC-EPN. The strategy was validated through an experimental design involving a control group (receiving a traditional course) and an experimental group (receiving the gamified course). The evaluation focuses on the analysis of the following variables: User Satisfaction, Approval Rate and Academic Performance.

We have examined it through our planned course delivery model with its foundation in the gamified flipped classroom learning approach. A six-week IT foundation course delivered to undergraduate students with majors in accounting, finance, marketing, and management. Two groups of students for this study: (1) an experimental group of 62 students with gamified course experience, and (2) a control group of 37 students through traditional learning. We performed a descriptive analysis mixed research approach to compare the results of the experimental with the control groups. The results showed a positive impact of the proposed course delivery model based on formal assessment marking, independent learning behavior, and improved class participation. However, this research has also identified various technological and delivery challenges faced by the participants, including students and teachers. © 2019 IEEE.",case study; education; Flipped classroom;

Existing studies in domains such as education, health, and enterprise show that gamication can have a positive impact on meeting these goals. However, there is still a lack of detailed insights into how certain game design elements aect user behavior and motivation. To gain further insight, this paper presents a user study in the eld with 20, 000 participants of a mobile e-commerce application over a one-month time period to analyze the impact of gamication in the e-commerce domain and to compare the eectiveness of tangible versus intangible rewards. Results show that gamication has a positive impact in the e-commerce domain. The study also reveals that tangible rewards increase the user activity substantially more than intangible rewards. We further show how tangible rewards aect certain user types and provide a rst discussion on the lastingness of these rewards. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",E-Commerce; Gamication; Intangible Rewards;

A gamification initiative making use of a mobile app to prepare students for their summative assessment was evaluated for its usefulness and successful application to meet the objective. At the time of the study it was the second year that this learning activity was incorporated into the course. Hundred and three students (N=103) enrolled for a degree and diploma in Sport and Recreation Management and Sport Science at a residential university in South Africa participated. Students were divided in teams of no more than five. Participation was voluntary, most students participated (85%). The app was quantitatively evaluated for ease of use. Students found the app easy to use. The gamification approach was qualitatively evaluated. Three themes emerged; usefulness of app, examination preparation and enjoyment. Valuable lessons were learned regarding designing and developing of game-based learning activities and the incorporation of technology. It is concluded that the further development of this initiative should be nested in a solid design framework and the use of technology must be carefully considered. © 2018, University of Stellenbosch.

At the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, anatomy teaching has traditionally been delivered via didactic means. To encourage more active learning, suitable games (non-digital) and the script concordance test were utilized to enhance the process. The flipped classroom approach was also introduced to further trigger active learning. In addition, the use of mobile apps (digital) was also initiated as supplements for SDL. Feedback was collected based on the previously validated PRO-SDL scale. Results from the research yielded inconclusive evidence to support enhanced motivation among our students due to gamification (P > 0.05). However, it did help to encourage active participation for a “fun learning” experience supported by numerous positive comments. More importantly, the participant's continuous assessment (CA1, CA2, and CA3) and objective specific practical exam results were better than the cohort's average (P < 0.05), suggesting that enhanced meta-cognition, and factual recall had taken place. While it is positive, there are some caveats to note with gamification, first and foremost, that it is tutor dependent. Taken together, gamification could represent a new paradigm for anatomy education, and also an opportune time to change the prevailing culture in the healthcare and education industry. Clin.

ClassDojo, as a study case, was implemented class-wide in a Moroccan High School EFL classroom. Data was gathered and saved directly through the application. It is qualitative research that opted for structured interviews to collect data. The findings were evaluated in so far as class motivation, participation, cooperation, discipline, attendance, and classroom discourse are concerned. This study has shown a crystal clear improvement in terms of discipline, motivations and classroom participation, suggesting the great need to conduct more research with a view to determine if these areas could be positively or negatively impacted when integrating ClassDojo in classroom management on a large scale. The findings of this study are of much significance to decision makers, curriculum developers, syllabus designers, and teachers in both senior and junior schools in Morocco. © 2019 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

In this scenario, the gamification technique emerges as a promising approach, considering the impact on the students’ motivation and appealing to their participation. This paper describes a systematic review addressing gamification in virtual learning environments (VLE), presenting an overview on how gamification has been applied in these scenarios. This review was based on papers published in highly scored journals in the field of computers in education. The papers were selected according to the gamification theme, and the content was analyzed and a state of the art built, according to the retrieved qualitative data. The results seem to reveal that there are significant gains derived from the adoption of gamification in VLE. However, some gains are not unanimous and it depends on how the elements are applied. This paper also suggests a basis for future work aiming at applying gamification in a VLE. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.",Gamification; Systematic review; Virtual learning environments,Computer aided instruction; Teaching; Computers in education; Gamification; Qualitative data; State of the art; Systematic Review; Teaching and learning environments; Virtual learning environments; E-learning,,,,,"Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior, CAPES; Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná, UTFPR",Acknowledgment.

Lecturers can measure how well students absorb information and tailor their teaching to the next step or re-teach a concept after poor uptake by students. Seventy-two students participated in a 20-question survey about their experiences with ‘KAHOOT!’. Engagement scores were correlated with assessment grades to measure if ‘KAHOOT!’ affected student learning and achievement. The survey was deemed statistically sound in reliability and validity testing, and a principal components analysis (PCA) revealed that the attributes were strongly linked. There was no relationship between engagement score and assessment grade, indicating that ‘KAHOOT’!’ did not directly increase achievement. However, assessment of individual responses identified that students found it to be a positive social learning technology as it provided a fun, competitive and immersive end to a class. The benefits of fostering engagement, enjoyment and immersion within adult learning are especially important for maintaining a level of achievement within education to ensure that students are better equipped to deal with challenges and can turn a potential failure into an opportunity to improve their scholarship.

The IMPRINT+ project, co-funded by Erasmus+ programme of the European Union, intends to promote an ecological reasoning at an European level, supported by the participation of local communities and particularly by young people.Based on ICT use (smart-phones, tablets and websites) and using a gamification strategy, the IMPRINT+ project aims to encourage young citizens to become aware of the global environmental impact of their everyday actions and to encourage them to act and participate in a local context. This paper aims to answer the question of what requirements, functional and non-functional, are appropriate to an app designed to engage young citizens, to be aware of their ecological footprint and to contribute, within different levels (individual, familiar, community or even national), with actions to its compensation. The paper describes the development process of the app, in terms of its specifications, requirements and system architecture. Preliminary tests suggest that the options made to develop the app were appropriate to promote the engagement of young people within the projects’ goals. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",Ecological reasoning; IMPRINT+ mobile app; Local community,E-learning; Ecology; Education; Environmental impact; Regional planning; Specifications; Sustainable development; Development process; Ecological footprint; Ecological reasoning; Global environmental impacts; Local community; Mobile app; System architectures; Technological specifications; Ecosystems,,,,,,,"Arts K., Van Der Wal R., Adams W.M., Digital technology and the conservation of nature, Ambio, 44, pp. 661-673, (2015); Charland A., Leroux B., Mobile application development, Commun ACM, 54, pp. 49-53, (2011); Crumlish C., Malone E., Designing Social Interfaces: Principles, Patterns, and Practices for Improving the User Experience, (2009); Guidance on Community-Led Local Development for Local Actors, (2014); Cohesion Policy 2014–2020 - Community-Led Local Development, (2014); Galan-Diaz C., Edwards P., Nelson J.D., Van Der Wal R., Digital innovation through partnership between nature conservation organisations and academia: A qualitative impact assessment, Ambio, 44, pp. 538-549, (2015); Goodwin K., Designing for the Digital Age, (2009); Hamari J., Koivisto J., Sarsa H., Does gamification work?

Gamification is being successfully applied in a diverse set of areas such as Education, Business, Human Resources, Health, and Entertainment. In general, gamified systems are designed and implemented for specific contexts. There is not a multipurpose approach that can be applied to many contexts. Informal groups are composed of members who come together online to perform work or social activities, fostering engagement, commitment and participation. We propose a framework to support the design of gamified experiences in general scenarios for collaborative informal groups. We built a context agnostic tool, called Gamefy, to evaluate the framework. We then evaluated motivation and flexibility enabled by the tool. We also employed the framework to assess the perceived usefulness of gamification features in two particular contexts. We then were able to identify key features to gamified experiences, and the possibility of differences in featuresâ€™ importance depending on context. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Collaboration; Framework; Gamification; Gamified experience; Technology,Information systems; Collaboration; Collaborative groups; Framework; Gamification; Gamified experience; Informal groups; Perceived usefulness; Social activities; Information use,,,,,"Johnson&Johnson; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico, CNPq, (Universal 01/2016 403921/2016-3)",Funding text 1: Acknowledgements.

In this paper, we report a case study whose methodology is based on awarding merit badges as a result of the successful completion of learning activities focused on either soft and hard skills. This initiative was implemented in two universities, involving 221 participants, aimed at assessing how the proposed model may contribute to students' motivation, appealing for its participation in the classroom, and measuring their stimulation for continuous study. Early stage results are promising and suggest not only a higher acceptance of the system and its effectiveness, but also, the suitability of gamification and reward systems on education. Further studies should be implemented in order to determine the effect of the reward system on students' grades. © 2019 IEEE.",Engaging learning; Gamification; Intrinsic motivation; Reward system; Student empowerment,Education computing; Engineering education; Motivation; Engaging learning; Gamification; Intrinsic motivation; Learning Activity; Reward systems; Student engagement; Students' grades; Students,,,,,,,"Caraher L., Millennials & Management: The Essential Guide to Making It Work at Work, (2016); Deci E.L., Ryan R.M., Cognitive evaluation theory, Intrinsic Motivation and Self-Determination in Human Behavior, pp. 43-85, (1985); Hopkins L., Et al., To the point: Medical education, technology, and the millennial learner, American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, 218, 2, pp. 188-192, (2018); McGonigal J., Reality is broken: Why games make us better and how they can change the world, Penguin Books, (2011); Hanus M.D., Fox J., Assessing the effects of gamification in the classroom: A longitudinal study on intrinsic motivation, social comparison, satisfaction, effort, and academic performance, Computers & Education, 80, pp. 152-161, (2015); Lister M., Gamification: The effect on student motivation and performance at the post-secondary level, Issues and Trends in Educational Technology, 3, 2, (2015); Deci E.L., Koestner R., Ryan R.M., Extrinsic rewards and intrinsic motivation in education: Reconsidered once again, Review of Educational Research, 71, 1, pp. 1-27, (2001); Skinner B.F., Science and Human Behavior, (1953); Kyewski E., Kramer N.C., To gamify or not to gamify?

In the educational context, recently, great efforts are being made to adapt the system to characteristics and needs of the students of the 21st century. Gamification in education consist on the use of structures, characteristics, dynamics and aesthetics of games for educational purposes, to increase students participation and motivation. The escape room is a gamified activity in which one or more teams must leave a place during a limited time solving a challenge whose goal is learning. This study pretends to analyze research trends through a bibliometric study of scientific production deposited in Scopus. 32 articles were obtained for the analysis. The results indicate an increase in scientific publications in last decade, and the main mean of dissemination are journals, specially in Social Sciences field. In addition, data shows the low impact and the absence of medium and large producers.

Usually, the CS degree suffers from low class attendance, which impacts the participation of students in in-class programming activities. Additionally, this degree includes a basic course related to human computer interaction that, despite of being valuable for the formation of students, they feel as boring and useless, far from their - heavily computer focused - interests. Then we decided to gamify a basic course of programming skills and the mentioned HCI course. We decided to use two different formats, online and physical. First, one experience was performed in “Human Factors in Computing” course of third year of studies, with 70 enrolled students. First, students attended to a 3D online theoretical class related to emotional design in “The education district” (TED) platform, which is a 3D Virtual World (VW) for educational purposes, developed by Virtway corporation. Afterwards, they participated in the 'Game of thrones' gamified activity where they evaluated the usability of TED. Second, we designed 'physical' gamified classes to increase attendance to Data Structures course, and in consequence, augment the number of programming exercises that students perform and the assistance they receive from the teacher. During the gamified sessions, the 120 enrolled students enhanced their skills in solving programming problems. The experience consisted of three kinds of challenges (with easy, medium, and hard difficulty level) solved in large, medium, and low-sized groups of students, respectively. The results of both experiences were satisfactory as evidenced by the percentage of students (>=66,7%) that rated the activities between 6 and 10 (in a 0 to 10 scale). © This work is licensed under a Creative Commons License CC BY-NC-ND 4.0",3D Virtual Worlds; Computer Science; Gamification,,,,,,,,"Baldeon J., Rodriguez I., Puig A., LEGA: a LEarner-centered GAmification design framework, Int.

Several campuses in Indonesia and abroad have already started the movement and integrate the colleges' data and provide a digital experience for the campus communities. In order to motivate the communities, in this case the students, to leverage IT tools and platforms to improve their learning experiences, utilizing gamification and mobile technologies are seen to be the suitable combinations. Gamification as a concept to enhance user participation is also gaining a lot of tractions in recent years, including in the higher education sector. Many researches have shown that gamification is effective to improve motivations in core learning activities, to push students to be more proactive in gaining knowledge. This research is conducted to integrate a new mobile application to the existing smart campus platform in Universitas Multimedia Nusantara, Indonesia, while also gamify several student routines and activities to enhance the campus experience. The system is built as a hybrid mobile application and evaluated for its user acceptance by analyzing its users' perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use which are derived from the technology acceptance model (TAM). Based on the feedbacks gathered from the users, the gamified system is perceived to be easy to use and useful to increase student's participation and to motivate the users to actively complete their campus routines. © 2018 Authors.",Gamification; Marczewski gamification framework; Smart campus; Technology acceptance model; Universitas Multimedia Nusantara,,,,,,Universitas Multimedia Nusan-tara,"This research is fully supported by Universitas Multimedia Nusan-tara.

Due to the need for communication, portability and ubiquity, several of these methods use mobile devices to achieve their goal. Laptops, smartphones and tablets, with access to wireless networks, can be used to improve teacher–student interaction and thereby stimulate students’ motivation, participation and active learning. Gamification is a teaching-learning strategy, which incorporates knowledge based on games that can support and mostly motivate the work of students and teachers. This document presents the results of a study using the Kahoot Platform, which is a web service of social and gamified education learning, in order to create evaluations changed into games of knowledge and competition among students. When it is used as a questionnaire, it challenges users to answer the questions posed, with a controlled response time, accumulated points, badges and a podium with the first five places. This leads to an active and dynamic learning due to the strong playful component, competitive and teamwork. The results of the research indicate that students improved participation and motivation in classes, besides checking that they had better results when working with mobile devices. These data will allow to analyze future perspectives about the use of the learning platform based on games as an assistance in the teaching-learning process. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",Active learning; Dynamic learning; Games; Gamification; M-learning; Mobile learning,E-learning; Knowledge based systems; Learning systems; Mobile telecommunication systems; Motivation; Problem solving; Web services; Active Learning; Dynamic learning; Games; Gamification; M-Learning; Mobile Learning; Students,,,,,,,"Chaiyo Y., The Effect of Kahoot, Quizizz and Google Forms on the student’s Perception in the Classrooms Response System, pp. 178-182, (2017); Araujo I., Empowering Teachers to Apply Gamification, pp. 1-5, (2017); Prabawa H., Gamification development in attainment concept model learning for students’ comprehension enhancement, In 3Rd International Conference on Science in Information Technology (Icsitech), Bandung, Indonesia, pp. 685-689, (2017); Freeman S., Active learning increases student performance in science, engineering, and mathematics, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 111, 23, pp. 8410-8415, (2014); Abidin H., November 9–10).

Especially in the digital era, students may quickly shift their attention from the class to other distractions such as smartphones and laptops. In this paper, we analyze the psychological causes of the attention loss problem and explore a new approach to restore students' attention level in classroom teaching. We borrow the attention locking mechanism from computer games and design a timely rewarding system to stimulate the students in class. When the students are repetitively stimulated by the lecturer, their attention would be tied to what the lecturer present in the class. We build an experimental system using wechat mini program technology. During a class, the students are asked to use their smartphones to scan QR codes appearing on the projector screen from time to time. Each scan will reward students with a fraction of the class participation points and lead the students into a preset teaching scenario such as attendance checking, random questioning, and quiz. Just like the ladder ranking system widely used in online computer games, students can see their ranking of accumulated participation points after class as a long term stimuli for study. We tested the proposed teaching approach in two courses with relatively large number of students. The experiment results show that both the student attendance and their attention level remain high for the entire semester. © 2018 IEEE.",Attention Restoration; Classroom Teaching; Gamification in Education; Rewarding Mechanism,Computer games; Education computing; Locks (fasteners); Restoration; Smartphones; Teaching; Attention restorations; Class participations; Classroom teaching; Experimental system; Gamification; Locking mechanism; Student attendances; Teaching approaches; Students,,,,,"Hunan university teaching reform fund 2017 and Hunan univeristy young scholar growth fund, (2016,2017)","The corresponding authors are Sheng Xiao (xiaosheng@hnu.edu.cn) and Yishan Tang (yishantang@hufe.edu.cn).

Gamification takes common game design principles such as points, leaderboards and competition, then applies them to non-gaming activities. Participants often require extrinsic motivators to engage with gamification, such as financial reward, compulsory participation or prizes. This approach can reduce intrinsic motivation, creativity and sense of agency. One powerful extrinsic motivator is competition, which can be effective even without any real world prize. Competition can be divided into constructive and destructive types. Destructive competition can cause anxiety and lower self-esteem in participants. Constructive competition is motivating without these negative side-effects. It isn't possible to guarantee that a competition will be constructive, but there are broad principles that can be applied to design for constructive competition. These principles were investigated using a purpose built mobile application called UniCraft. This app was used in a crossover study with university students in an attempt to increase their satisfaction with one of their subjects and it featured a 3D video game-like competitive battle mode. Online analytics recorded a statistically significant increase in app usage when this competitive game mode was enabled. © 2018 EUROSIS-ETI.",Constructive competition; Education; Gamification; Mobile; Video games,Education; Human computer interaction; Interactive computer graphics; Motivation; Competitive games; Gamification; Intrinsic motivation; Mobile; Mobile applications; Negative side effects; University students; Video game; Three dimensional computer graphics,,,,,,,"Adams E., Fundamentals of game design, New Riders., (2013); Axon S., Unity at 10: For Better-or Worse-game Development Has Never Been Easier, (2016); Behm-Morawitz E., Mirrored selves: The influence of self-presence in a virtual world on health, appearance, and well-being, Comput.

Design In July 2016, we instituted a gamified microblogging project using Twitter as the platform and modified questions from one of several available question banks. A question of the day was posted at 7-o׳clock each morning, Monday through Friday. Respondents were awarded points for speed, accuracy, and contribution to discussion topics. The moderator challenged respondents by asking additional questions and prompted them to find evidence for their claims to fuel further discussion. Since 4 months into the microblogging program, a survey was administered to all residents. Responses were collected and analyzed. After 6 months of tweeting, residents took the ABSITE examination. We compared participating residents׳ ABSITE percentile rank to those of their nonparticipating peers. We also compared residents׳ percentile rank from 2016 to those in 2017 after their participation in the microblogging project. Setting The University of Connecticut general surgery residency is an integrated program that is decentralized across 5 hospitals in the central Connecticut region, including Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center, located in Hartford. Participants We advertised our account to the University of Connecticut general surgery residents. Out of 45 residents, 11 participated in Twitter microblogging (24.4%) and 17 responded to the questionnaire (37.8%). Results In all, 100% of the residents who were participating in Twitter reported that daily microblogging prompted them to engage in academic reading. Twitter participants significantly increased their ABSITE percentile rank from 2016 to 2017 by an average of 13.7% (±14.1%) while nonparticipants on average decreased their ABSITE percentile rank by 10.0% (±16.6) (p = 0.003). Conclusions Microblogging via Twitter with gamification is a feasible strategy to facilitate improving performance on the ABSITE, especially in a geographically distributed residency. © 2017 Association of Program Directors in Surgery",ABSITE; Interpersonal and Communication Skills; Medical Knowledge; Practice-Based Learning and Improvement; resident education; social media; survey,"Adult; Blogging; Certification; Clinical Competence; Connecticut; Curriculum; Education, Medical, Graduate; Female; General Surgery; Humans; Inservice Training; Internship and Residency; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Problem-Based Learning; Social Media; Specialty Boards; Surveys and Questionnaires; academic achievement; Article; blogging; communication skill; female; general surgery; human; in service training; knowledge base; male; medical examination; multiple choice test; normal human; priority journal; reading; residency education; sex difference; social media; surgical training; adult; blogging; certification; clinical competence; comparative study; Connecticut; curriculum; education; human relation; in service training; medical education; problem based learning; procedures; questionnaire",,,,,,,"Jones A.T., Biester T.W., Buyske J., Lewis F.R., Malangoni M.A., Using the American Board of Surgery In-Training Examination to predict board certification: a cautionary study, J Surg Educ, 71, 6, pp. e144-e148, (2014); Mehta N., Flickinger T., The times they are a-changin׳: academia, social media and the JGIM Twitter Journal Club, J Gen Intern Med, 29, 10, (2014); Choo E.K., Et al., Twitter as a tool for communication and knowledge exchange in academic medicine: a guide for skeptics and novices, Med Teach, 37, 5, pp. 411-416, (2015); Forgie S.E., Duff J.P., Ross S., Twelve tips for using Twitter as a learning tool in medical education, Med Teach, 35, 1, pp. 8-14, (2013); El Bialy S., Jalali A., Go where the students are: a comparison of the use of social networking sites between medical students and medical educators, JMIR Med Educ, 1, 2, (2015); Bergl P.A., Narang A., Arora V.M., Maintaining a Twitter feed to advance an internal medicine residency program׳s educational mission, JMIR Med Educ, 1, 2, (2015); Galiatsatos P., Porto-Carreiro F., Hayashi J., Zakaria S., Christmas C., The use of social media to supplement resident medical education—the SMART-ME initiative, Med Educ Online, 21, (2016); Desai T., Patwardhan M., Coore H., Factors that contribute to social media influence within an Internal Medicine Twitter learning community, F1000Res, 3, 120, pp. 1-7, (2014); Mesko B., Gyorffy Z., Kollar J.a., Digital literacy in the medical curriculum: a course with social media tools and gamification, JMIR Med Educ, 1, 2, (2015); Mokadam N.A., Lee R., Vaporciyan A.A., Gamification in thoracic surgical education: using competition to fuel performance, J Thorac Cardiovas Surg, 150, 5, pp. 1052-1058, (2015); Hsu Y.-C., Ching Y.-H., Mobile microblogging: using Twitter and mobile devices in an online course to promote learning in authentic contexts, The International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning, 13, 4, pp. 211-227, (2012); Bahner D.P., Eric A., Nilesh P., Chad D., Rollin N., Nicholas E.

Two focus groups (FGs) of children aged 10-12 years were formed, for the design, development, and evaluation of educational tools for gamification techniques on the subject of sustainable mobility. The study involved a group of children from three classes in the fifth-year of primary education at a school in the City of Burgos (Spain). The first focus group revealed the cognitive perceptions of the children toward sustainable mobility and their cognitive understanding of its need. The information was used in the design of learning activities of gamification techniques. The children in the second focus group, after the educational experience, were evaluated with regard to the knowledge they had acquired on the topic and changes in their attitudes. The basic knowledge of children before their participation in the research was limited to the environmental aspects of sustainable mobility, as we observed in the first focus group. Through the use of the gamification tools, the children acquired new concepts that clarified the importance of social and economic components linked to sustainable mobility, and they started to develop an awareness of how to play an active role in changing their behavior. © 2019 by the authors.",Early education; Focus group; Gamification; Sustainable mobility education,Burgos [Castilla y Leon]; Castilla y Leon; Spain; cognition; design method; knowledge; learning; mobility; perception; primary education; sustainable development,,,,,Ministero dell’Istruzione dell’Università e della Ricerca of the Italian Government; University of Burgos,Funding: We would like to thank the Ministero dell’Istruzione dell’Università e della Ricerca of the Italian Government for funding the PhD studies of Silvia Sipone in the University of Burgos (Spain).,"Larson K., Grudens-Schuck N., Allen B., Methodology Brief: Can You Call It a Focus Group?

The investigation was conducted over two years, starting with a pilot model applied to a total of 80 students belonging to three different groups, using a gamification model with more than 30 activities (missions) built using Rezzly. The student performance results in gamified activities, and the opinion survey conducted at the end of the semester showed a wide acceptance of the model (more than 50%). Consequently, the gamification model was redesigned, based on the Octalysis framework proposed by Yu-Kai Chou, and constructed using Google Classroom for its implementation during the August-December 2019 semester. The final model included 45 gamified activities implemented for 650 students in 20 groups (classes) in four science subjects, namely, Energy and Transformation (17), Matter and the Environment (1), Fundamentals of Life (1), and Physics for the IB Diploma (1). The following statistics indicate the success of the model and the feasibility of using gamification to motivate and engage students and improve their academic development: a) in total, the students performed 21,673 activities; b) student participation grew from 77.8% in the first period to 83.3% in the final period, and c) the results of the mid and final student opinion surveys indicated that 93.4% of the students would like the model to be replicated in other classes, and 77% of the students considered that the activities helped ""pretty much"" in their learning process. Based on these results, we propose this successful gamification model, which can be adapted and implemented in other subjects, and we provide the evidence of the most significant gamification elements, as specified by the high school students in the research. Also, this work can be used to create a free-access gamification model for science subjects. © 2020 Dechema e.V..

Considering the distribution of Muslim wealth as a tool in achieving the highest objective in Islam, it is important to have a better understanding in order to use it in times of hardship. Past research has claimed that hibah is considered as an alternative to avoid unclaimed Muslim asset. On May 2017, Hibah amanah had been introduced by Tabung Haji as an alternative to the current, Nomination system. The purpose of this research is to identify the relationship between demographic with the participation of depositor in Hibah Amanah Tabung Haji Johor Bahru (THJB). This research also aims to determine the level of relationship between understanding of depositors and contribution of depositor on the product promoted. A sample of 50 questionnaires had been distributed to the THJB depositors as THJB is the headquarters of Tabung Haji Johor. Result shows that there is significance and positive correlation between knowledge and participation of depositors.

Previous studies have examine factors that improves employee participation, motivation and engagement that leads to the employee intentions to use gamification for training. Therefore, in this study, task technology fit (TTF), social motivations (SM) and knowledge gain from using gamifiction were investigated. The TAM is enhanced with other factors; such as the task technology fit (TTF) and social motivation. The TTF is used to examine gamification utility, while social motivation is used to examine social influence (SI) and social recognition (SR). Data were collected in two phases, in the first phase 375 data were used for the TAM, secondly, 31 data were used for the pre and posttest. A structural equation model were presented to test the TAM while the t-Test were used to study the knowledge gain from using the gamification system. However, the foundation for understanding instructors' behavior in this study's context are: (1) perceived usefulness and attitudes are crucial to the continuance intentions to use gamified Moodle for training; (2) perceived usefulness mediates the relationships among social recognition, TTF, perceived ease of use, and social influence on continuance intentions; (3) when predicting continuance intentions, TTF, social recognition, social influence, and perceived ease of use are vital; (4) TTF positively affects perceived ease of use; and, unexpectedly, (5) the TTF and social influence have no significant effects on perceived usefulness. Detailed results and educational implications are discussed. © 2013 IEEE.",and social motivation; Gamification; gamification in higher institution; gamified Moodle training platform; motivation; task technology fit; technology acceptance model,Engineering education; Gamification; Motivation; Personnel training; Employee participation; Motivation and engagements; Social motivations; Structural equation modeling; Task technology fit; Tasktechnology fits (TTF); Technology acceptance model; Training platform; Economic and social effects,,,,,,,"Ajayi I.H., Iahad N.A., Ahmad N., Yusof A.F., A proposed conceptual model for fiipped learning, J.

However, research to date consistently reports poor user engagement and retention. The current study examined user engagement, compliance and retention with Active Team—a gamified physical activity intervention delivered by via an online Facebook application. Associations between engagement and participant (n = 51) demographic and team characteristics (sex, age, education and team size) were examined, as well as temporal trends in engagement during the 50-day intervention. Analyses revealed significant associations between both engagement (p = <0.001) and gamification (p = 0.04) with education, with participants in the middle education category appearing to have the highest rates of engagement and use of gamification features. Gender was also related to engagement, with males demonstrating the highest use of the intervention’s gamification features (p = 0.004). Although compliance was consistently high for the duration, engagement declined steadily throughout the intervention. Engagement peaked on Wednesdays, coinciding with the delivery of a customised email reminder. Findings reveal individual differences in engagement with Active Team, highlighting a need to tailor interventions to the target audience. Gamification features may enhance engagement amongst males, who are traditionally recognised as a difficult demographic group to engage. Finally, the use of customised, periodic push reminders delivered by email may enhance user engagement by drawing them back to the intervention and helping to sustain intervention behaviours. © 2017, Society of Behavioral Medicine.",Engagement; Facebook; Gamification; Health behaviour interventions; Online social networks; Physical activity,Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Electronic Mail; Exercise; Female; Health Promotion; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Compliance; Patient Participation; Reminder Systems; Sex Factors; Social Media; Social Networking; Time Factors; Video Games; Young Adult; Article; e-mail; female; game; health behavior; human; male; outcome assessment; patient compliance; patient participation; physical activity; priority journal; reminder system; social network; adolescent; adult; aged; exercise; health promotion; middle aged; patient compliance; patient participation; procedures; sex factor; social media; social network; time factor; video game; young adult,,,,,"Australian National Heart Foundation, (100188)",Acknowledgements: Carol Maher is the recipient of a Post-Doctoral Fellowship Award from the Australian National Heart Foundation (100188).,"Cavallo D.N., Tate D.F., Ries A.V., Et al., A social media-based physical activity intervention: a randomized controlled trial, American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 43, pp. 527-532, (2012); Turner-McGrievy G., Tate D., Tweets, apps, and pods: results of the 6-month mobile pounds off digitally (mobile POD) randomized weight-loss intervention among adults, Journal of Medical Internet Research, 13, (2011); Statista.

In pursuit of energy efficiency and true sustainability, buildings must acquire the ability to interact as well as to generate synergies. The most prominent features of this approach are energy management and information flows which, intelligently designed, not only enhance buildings' capabilities, but introduce a significant change in their relationship with the surrounds ('smart cities') and its inhabitants. This new paradigm calls for revisiting architectural undergraduate instruction, adopting a more complex overview of energy use and management in the design process, regarding buildings as dynamic rather than static entities. The methodology focuses on creating learning environments that favour students' participation in problem solving and assessment, encouraging teamwork based on case studies and stressing the connection between this new architecture, ICTs included, and social networks as participatory design tools. These ideas were implemented in a pilot learning experience conducted at the University of Seville for undergraduate students. As a result the inclusion of ICTs and the collaboration of extra-academic realms boosts student promotion and projection beyond the academic environment and their introduction in the professional community.

We first introduce the education institutions. Then, at the methodological level, an analytical model is designed and applied to five interactive applications that have been recently developed for these purposes. The results indicate that teaching young people using methods based on new media involves various new applications and platforms that meet their current needs and life rhythms better than other traditional teaching methods. © 2015, Universidad del Zulia.

Despite positive anecdotal reports, there is currently little empirical evidence to support their efficacy in particular domains. With the recent rapid growth of tools for online learning, an interesting open question for educators is the extent to which badges can positively impact student participation. In this paper, we report on a large-scale (n > 1000) randomized, controlled experiment measuring the impact of incorporating a badge-based achievement system within an online learning tool. We discover a highly significant positive effect on the quantity of students' contributions, without a corresponding reduction in their quality, as well as on the period of time over which students engaged with the tool. Students enjoyed being able to earn badges, and indicated a strong preference for having them available in the user interface.

However, it is proved challenging to engage participants in PD activities, as shown by our practical experiences in a research project that is aimed to support teaching and learning of science with online labs and associated resources. Challenges include identifying convincing arguments about benefits of participation and demonstrating impacts their participation can have. We propose the use of an online tool such as PDot to support the traceability of PD feedback and the possibility of audio input. We will also explore the gamification of participation.

Gamification is a novel technique that uses game elements like points and badges, to motivated and engage users into embracing new behaviors, such as improving one's health condition, finances or productivity. In this paper, we present an experiment in which an MSc college course was gamified to improve student interest and engagement. The gamified course led to better learning results and participation. However, there were several negative side effects that detracted from the overall experience. We will describe them, identifying their causes and describe possible alternatives to better tailor the gamified experience, stemming from the analysis of the data gathered so far. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Education Gamification; Motivation; Perils; Student engagement,Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Motivation; College course; Engineering course; Gamification; Health condition; Negative side effects; Novel techniques; Perils; Student engagement; Students,,,,,,,"Deterding S., Dixon D., Khaled R., Nacke L., From game design elements to gamefulness: Defining "" gamification, Proc. 15th International Academic MindTrek Conf.

Data include interviews and focus groups with 43 students, and interviews with 24 teachers and afterschool mentors and one college admissions director. Across all stakeholders, the most frequently cited opportunity related to the potential that badges hold for establishing learners' credibility outside the context in which their badges were earned by providing a trustworthy record of the skills and achievements that students gain through their participation in the afterschool programs. However, credibility also emerged as the dominant challenge associated with digital badges. Participants observed that in order for badges to succeed in proving one's credibility to external audiences, these audiences - such as college admissions officers and employers - must know about and recognize the validity of badges. Students, teachers, and program staff all expressed the belief that this essential criterion had not yet been achieved. We examine these findings in light of theory and research on the role of artifacts within and outside the communities of practice in which they were created and used. The findings hold implications for designers of openly networked learning environments that seek to span and connect diverse social settings. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Not only being applied on the commercial market to attract consumers, gamification is also used in educational context by teachers to help keeping students engaged and motivated in the physical classrooms. This paper furthermore upraises the discussion of how the gamification strategies can be implemented online for a website with academic purposes to retain its members, and what of which are the members' most concerns a designer should adapt to if time and resource are limited. Examples are given and an online survey of 73 subjects with empirical experience was conduct to reveal that among those game mechanisms proposed, the graphical feedbacks are the subjects' most concerns, followed by the gamified theme activity and discussion board. For websites which are not gameplay purposed this paper could provide useful suggestions for the designers who try to use gamification for enhancing the audience's participation and enthusiasm, even for educational purposes.",Engagement; Game elements; Game mechanisms; Gamification; Motivation,Design; Education; Motivation; Social networking (online); Students; Teaching; Websites; Commercial market; Discussion boards; Educational context; Engagement; Game elements; Gamification; Motivation and engagements; Online surveys; Web Design,,,,,,,"Brathwaite B., Schreiber I., Challenges for Game Designers Retrieved from, (2009); Gamification 101: An Introduction to the Use of Game Dynamics to Influence Behavior, (2010); (2014); De-Marcos L., Dominguez A., Saenz-De-Navarrete J., Pages C., An empirical study comparing gamification and social networking on e-learning, Computers & Education, 75, 0, pp. 82-91, (2014); Deci E.L., Koestner R., Ryan R.M., Extrinsic rewards and intrinsic motivation in education: Reconsidered once again, Review of Educational Research, 71, 1, pp. 1-27, (2001); Deterding S., Dixon D., Khaled R., Nacke L., From game design elements to gamefulness: Defining ""gamification, Paper Presented at the Proceedings of the 15th International Academic MindTrek Conference: Envisioning Future Media Environments, (2011); Dominguez A., Saenz-De-Navarrete J., De-Marcos L., Fernandez-Sanz L., Pages C., Martinez-Herraiz J.-J., Gamifying learning experiences: Practical implications and outcomes, Computers & Education, 63, pp. 380-392, (2013); Fioriello P., 25 Things Teachers Should Know about Gamification, (2013); Flatla D.R., Gutwin C., Nacke L.E., Bateman S., Mandryk R.L., Calibration games: Making calibration tasks enjoyable by adding motivating game elements, Paper Presented at the Proceedings of the 24th Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology, (2011); Wang H.S., Game reward systems: Gaming experiences and social meanings, Paper Presented at the Think Design Play: The Fifth International Conference of the Digital Research Association (DIGRA), (2011); Lepi K., How to Gamify Your Classroom in 6 Easy Steps, (2013); Nicholson S., A user-centered theoretical framework for meaningful gamification, (2012); Reeves B., Read J.L., Total Engagement: Using Games and Virtual Worlds to Change the Way People Work and Businesses Compete, (2009); Ryan R.M., Deci E.L., Intrinsic and extrinsic motivations: Classic definitions and new directions, Contemporary Educational Psychology, 25, 1, pp. 54-67, (2000)",,Ogata H.; Lomicka-Anderson L.; Chai C.-S.; Hampel R.; Hayashi Y.; Vassileva J.; Liu C.-C.; Chen W.; Hsu J.; Lan Y.-J.; Mason J.; Yamada M.; Shyu H.-Y.; Weerasinghe A.; Wu Y.-T.; Zhang L.; Kinshuk null; Matsubara Y.; Miao Y.; Ogata H.; Kong S.C.; Chang M.; Jong M.S.Y.; Kuo R.; Robson R.; Wasson B.; Kashihara A.; Cress U.; Jansen M.; Oshima J.; Yin C.; Zhang J.; Chinn C.,Asia-Pacific Society for Computers in Education,"et al.; KANSAI-OSAKA 21st Century Association; KDDI Foundation; Support Center for Advanced Telecommunications Technology Research, Foundation; Tateisi Science and Technology Foundation; The Telecommunications Advancement Foundation","22nd International Conference on Computers in Education, ICCE 2014",30 November 2014 through 4 December 2014,Nara,110495,,978-499080141-0,,,English,"Proc.

One goal of teachers should therefore be to decrease anonymityinthe classroombyusingimmediacy, like talkingtostudents and knowing their names. However, this is not always feasible if the class size is significantly larger than regular classes. Our approach tries to get the participants to install our developed artifact called C4mpUs on their personal devices, in order to create a gamified learning environment that enables a playful opportunity to connect with other peers. This way anonymity is broken down by students themselves rather than by the instructor. Our findings show that students tend to approach other participants they haven't met before, rather than only connect with familiar peers. However, more research will need to be done to determine on further extending the level of participation when it comes to diminishing anonymity as well as on how to integrate pedagogy.",Anonymity; Gamification;

We report about an experimental attempt during the Autumn 2013 semester at ETH Zurich, involving our \Introduction to Programming course. We designed and implemented a MOOC infrastructure and used it as a SPOC (Small Private Online Course) to support and complement the existing course. The results reported in this article are encouraging for two reasons: first, the participation level was good, in spite of the fact that the online course was an optional addition to the residential course; second, students really liked the assessments (quizzes and programming exercises), in spite of the fact that assessments did not count towards the course final grade. The data we collected suggest that this may, at least in part, be due to a gamification aspect we introduced in the course: Awarding virtual badges for obtaining full points in the quizzes. © 2014 ACM.",CS1; MOOC; Pedagogy; SPOC,Engineering research; Housing; Teaching; CS1; Introduction to programming; Massive open online course; MOOC; Pedagogy; Programming exercise; Residential course; SPOC; E-learning,,,,,,,"Eiffel 4 Mooc, (2014); Moodle Virtual Learning Environment, (2014); Chang C., Computing Curricula 2001 Computer Science: The Joint Task Force on Computing Curricula, (2014); ECMA International Standard 367: Eiffel Analysis Design and Programming Language, (2006); Fox A., From MOOCs to SPOCs.

Case examples of games used in three contextual areas are presented: education about clinical trials to encourage consideration of trial participation, the use of games to measure objective health outcomes, and the use of gamification approaches to drive positive patient compliance behavior and reduce unnecessary withdrawals during clinical studies. It is concluded that the use of gamification to enhance compliance and retention offers great potential. Games to measure health outcomes offer particular value in niche indications, but their universal applicability needs to be especially considered if they are to be used in non-supervised settings. © 2015 IEEE.",clinical trials; education; engagement; gamification; health; serious video games,Education; Health; Human computer interaction; Clinical study; Clinical trial; engagement; Gamification; Health outcomes; Patient compliance; Video game; Serious games,,,,,,,"Tufts Centre for the Study of Drug Development, Cost to Develop and Win Marketing Approval for A New Drug Is $2.6 Billion, (2014); Gartner Inc., Boosting the Predictability of Clinical Trial Performance, Gartner Case Study, (2007); FDA Rejects Wider Use of Xarelto Drug, (2014); Harris Interactive Inc., Misconceptions and lack of awareness greatly reduce recruitment for cancer clinical trials, Health Care News, (2001); Rowbotham M.C., Astin J., Greene K., Cummings S.R., Interactive Informed Consent: Randomized Comparison with Paper Consents, PLoS ONE, 8, 3, (2013); Marceau L., Paper Kingdom Video Game; Marceau L., Gerstenberger E., Maurao M., Coleman J., Kirkley S., Paper Kingdom: Solving Mysteries about Clinical Trials Via Serious Video Game; Matczak G., Increasing Clinical Trial Literacy with An Interactive Web App. Lilly Clinical Open Innovation, (2013); Wesnes K.A., Simpson P.M., Christmas L., The assessment of human information processing abilities in psychopharmacology, Human Psychopharmacology, Measures and Methods, pp. 79-92, (1987); Akili Interactive Labs Announces Partnership with Pfizer to Test Video Game in People at Risk of Alzheimer's Disease, (2014); Lowes L.P., Et al., Proof of concept of the ability of the kinect to quantify upper extremity function in dystrophinopathy, PLoS Currents, 5, (2013); Deterding S., Et al., Gamification: Using game design elements in nongaming contexts, Proceedings of the International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, (2011); Cooper S., Et al., Predicting protein structures with a multiplayer online game, Nature, 466, pp. 756-760, (2010); Robson K., Et al., Is it all a game?

CoPs have been applied to diverse environments, including organizations, education, associations and the social sector, as well as the governmental institutions and international development. A community of practice may emerge from both bottom-up or top-down initiatives and it will exist as long as the members believe they have something to contribute to it, or gain from it. The widespread access to personal computers and to the internet made the virtual environment very interesting for communities of practice, providing collaboration tools and both synchronous and asynchronous forms of communication. However, some differences and drawbacks in the interaction between individuals are also registered in the translation to the virtual environment. Keeping these communities alive depends a lot on the motivation of members, on their commitment and will to participate. Those are not easy to attain and maintain, especially on the online environment. Different approaches have been implemented to animate a community (be it real or virtual) and ensure a high level of communication and experience sharing. Of course, providing a rich and valuable knowledge repository is crucial, but the question is, how to turn passive community members into active participants? In this paper we present three communities of practice with completely different domains and communities (footwear industry professionals, trainers and trainees; innovation and marketing students, teachers and experts; and serious games practitioners and researchers). We compare the approaches that were used to animate the individuals to participate and to be involved in those communities. In particular, we present the results of using gamification as a form of motivating participants.",Collaboration; Communities of practice; Gamification; Motivation; Participation; Serious games,Communication; Motivation; Personal computers; Teaching; Virtual reality; Collaboration; Communities of Practice; Gamification; Participation; Serious games; Knowledge acquisition,,,,,,,"Ardichvili A., Page V., Wentling T., Motivation and Barriers to Participation Virtual Knowledge-Sharing Communities Of Practice, (2002); Brown J.S., Duguid P., Balancing Act: How to Capture Knowledge Without Killing It, Harvard Business Review, 78, pp. 73-80, (2000); Chou Y.-K., Octalysis: Complete Gamification Framework, (2013); Csikszentmihalyi M., Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience, (1990); Deterding S., Pawned.

Numerous studies have shown that by adopting a gamification-based course design, students’ participation and learning effectiveness can be improved. In order to gamify a course, some key rules must be followed. However, this increases the complexity of the course design as well as subsequent implementation. Therefore, in this study, a game procedure-based concept was incorporated into the gaming design. In addition, design samples from 3D software education were used to create an example-based learning (EBL) environment to lower the difficulty of gamification learning designs and maintain course appeal. Furthermore, the MOOCs platform was utilized to facilitate blended-based learning, which improved students’ learning satisfaction. Finally, the Likert scale was used to design a questionnaire to assess students’ learning motivation and investigate the effect of applying a game play process and gamification examples in course planning on students’ 3D software education learning results. Improve two-semester course shortened to one term, and maintain the effectiveness of student learning. © 2017 ICIC International.",3D education; Blended-based learning; Example-based learning; Game play; Gamification,,,,,,,,"Wu Q.S., Jian H.M., Analyzing Technical and Vocational Education Reforms between 1996 and 2007, Higher Education Reform, (2014); Online Learning System; Kapp K.M., The Gamification of Learning and Instruction: Game-Based Methods and Strategies for Training and Education, (2012); Huotari K., Hamari J., Defining gamification – A service marketing perspective, Proc. of the 16Th International Academic Mindtrek Conference, pp. 3-5, (2012); Inoue A., Era of Gamification, China Times, (2013); Prensky M., Digital Game-Based Learning, (2007); Deterding S., Khaled R., Nacke L.E., Dixon D., Gamification: Toward a definition, Proc. of Chi 2011 Gamification Workshop, pp. 12-15, (2011); Fuchs M., Fizek S., Ruffino P., Schrape N., Rethinking Gamification, (2014); Buckley P., Doyle E., Gamification and student motivation, Interactive Learning Environments, pp. 1-14, (2014); Deterding S., Dixon D., Khaled R., Nacke L., From game design elements to gamefulness: Defining gamification, Proc. of the 15Th International Academic Mindtrek Conference: Envisioning Future Media Environments, pp. 9-15, (2011); Huotari K., Hamari J., Defining gamification: A service marketing perspective, Proc. of the 16Th International Academic Mindtrek Conference, pp. 17-22, (2012); Chou Y.K., Octalysis: Complete Gamification Framework, (2013); Sweller J., van Merrienboer J.J., Paas F.G., Cognitive architecture and instructional design, Educational Psychology Review, 10, 3, pp. 251-296, (1998); van Gog T., Rummel N., Example-based learning: Integrating cognitive and social-cognitive research perspectives, Educational Psychology Review, 22, 2, pp. 155-174, (2010); Woltering V., Herrler A., Spitzer K., Spreckelsen C., Blended learning positively affects students’ satisfaction and the role of the tutor in the problem-based learning process: Results of a mixedmethod evaluation, Advances in Health Sciences Education, 14, 5, pp. 725-738, (2009); Garrison D.R., Kanuka H., Blended learning: Uncovering its transformative potential in higher education, The Internet and Higher Education, 7, 2, pp. 95-105, (2004); Sun H., Chiu Y.-P., Improving a digital sculpture tool for tutorials regarding 3D game art instruction, ICIC Express Letters, Part B: Applications, 6, 2, pp. 479-484, (2015); Sun H., Chiu Y.-P., Applying artistic anatomy to the teaching of topology modeling, ICIC Express Letters, Part B: Applications, 6, 2, pp. 541-547, (2015); Likert R., A technique for the measurement of attitudes, Archives of Psychology, 22, 140, pp. 1-55, (1932)","Y.-C.

The few experiences reported hitherto mainly concentrate on fostering participation and engagement in the training intervention itself. By contrast, we believe that gamification of TPD can and should have a broader scope, helping to enhance teachers' motivation to apply newly acquired knowledge and approaches in their daily practice. Accordingly, we have sought to gamify an existing TPD environment called 4Ts, which encourages teachers to design collaborative learning activities for their students via a specific theoretic approach (4Ts). In this paper, we describe the selection and integration of gamification mechanics in 4Ts following an existing methodology that, while generic, has nonetheless proved useful for gamification in the education field. The paper illustrates both the methodology and the experience of gamifying 4Ts with a view to potential transferability to similar, educational contexts.",Continuous professional development; Gamification; Learning design,,,,,,,,"Bingimlas K.A., Barriers to the successful integration of ICT in teaching and learning environments: a review of the literature, Eurasia Journal of Mathematics, Science & Technology Education, 5, 3, pp. 235-245, (2009); Ertmer P.A., Ottenbreit-Leftwich A., Removing obstacles to the pedagogical changes required by Jonassen's vision of authentic technology-enabled learning, Computers and Education, 64, pp. 175-182, (2012); Russell M., Bebell D., O'Dwyer L., O'Connor K., Examining teacher technology use-Implications for preservice and inservice teacher preparation, Journal of Teacher Education, 54, 4, pp. 297-310, (2003); Pelgrum W.J., Obstacles to the integration of ICT in education: results from a worldwide educational assessment, Computers & Education, 37, pp. 163-178, (2001); Dalziel J., Conole G., Wills S., Walker S., Bennett S., Dobozy E., Cameron L., Badilescu-Buga E., Bower M., The Larnaca Declaration on Learning Design 2013, (2014); Bennett S., Agostinho S., Lockyer L., Technology tools to support learning design: Implications derived from an investigation of university teachers' design practices, Computers & Education, 81, pp. 211-220, (2015); Masterman E., Manton M., Teachers' perspectives on digital tools for pedagogic planning and design, Technology, Pedagogy and Education, 20, pp. 227-246, (2011); Voogt J., Westbroek H., Handelzalts A., Walraven A., McKenney S., Pieters J., De Vries B., Teacher learning in collaborative curriculum design, Teaching and Teacher Education, 27, 8, pp. 1235-1244, (2011); Mor Y., Craft B., Hernandez-Leo D., Editorial: The art and science of learning design, Research in Learning Technology, 21, (2013); Hernandez-Leo D., Chacon J., Prieto L.P., Asensio-Perez J.I., Derntl M., Towards an Integrated Learning Design Environment, in Scaling up Learning for Sustained Impact, LNCS, vol, 8095, pp. 448-453, (2013); Lockyer L., Bennett S., Agostinho S., Harper: Handbook of Research on Learning Design and Learning Objects: Technologies, 1, (2009); Collazos C., Padilla N., Pozzi F., Guerrero L., Gutierrez F., Design guidelines to foster cooperation in digital environments, Technology, Pedagogy and Education, 3, 3, (2014); Pozzi F., Ceregini A., Persico D., Designing networked learning with 4T, Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Networked Learning, 2016, pp. 210-217, (2016); Pozzi F., Persico D., Dimitriadis Y., Joubert M., Tissenbaum M., Tsovaltzi D., Voigt C., Wise A., Structuring online collaboration through 3Ts: Task, Time and Teams, White Paper at the STELLAR Alpine Rendez-Vous 2011, (2011); Persico D., Pozzi F., Task, Teams and Time: Three Ts to structure CSCL processes, Techniques for fostering collaboration in online learning communities: theoretical and practical perspectives, Information Science Reference-IGI Global, (2011); Pozzi F., Persico D., Task, Teams and Time to structure online collaboration in learning environments, WJET-World Journal on Educational Technology, 3, 1, pp. 1-15, (2011); Pozzi F., Ceregini A., Persico D., ProgeTTTTare l'apprendimento collaborativo con 4T, TD Tecnologie Didattiche, 23, 3, pp. 132-138, (2015); Ryan R.M., Deci E.L., Self-determination theory and the facilitation of intrinsic motivation, social development and well-being, American Psychologist, 55, pp. 68-78, (2000); Connolly T.M., Boyle E.A., MacArthur E., Hainey T., Boyle J.M., A systematic literature review of empirical evidence on computer games and serious games, Computers & Education, 59 (2), pp. 661-686, (2012); Seaborn K., Fels D.I., Gamification in theory and action: A survey, International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 74, pp. 14-31, (2015); Kapp K.M., The gamification of learning and instruction, (2012); Hunike R., LeBlanc M., Zubek R., MDA: A Formal Approach to Game Design and Game Research, Proceedings of the Challenges in Game AI Workshop, 19th National Conference on Artificial Intelligence, (2004); Aparicio A.F., Vela F.L.G., Sanchez J.L.G., Montes J.L.I., Analysis and application of gamification, Proceedings of INTERACCION '12, pp. 1-2, (2012); Muntean C.I., Raising engagement in e-learning through gamification, Proceedings of 6th International Conference on Virtual Learning ICVL, pp. 323-329, (2011); Silva E., Gamifying learning with social gaming mechanics, in N.

Attracting and retaining students involves engagement and enjoyment at the individual, team, and class level. We explored the effects of these factors with a gamified approach to programming practice in an introductory computer science course. Gamification involves the use of game design elements in a non-game context to engage and motivate students. We present a novel learning game and the results of play-testing with 12 CS1 students. Students were surveyed prior to and after the gamified programming session. Positive feedback was obtained from the students and the educators observed high participation, interaction, and successful team programming efforts. We objectively report student satisfaction with the game, lessons learned by the educators, and suggest future work for stimulating students in introductory STEM courses. © 2015 IEEE.",Computer science education research; CS1; Experience report; Gamification,"Computer programming; Education computing; Gamification; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics); Computer science education research; Experience report; Introductory computer science; Introductory course; Programming practices; Student experiences; Student satisfaction; Team programming; Students",,,,,,,"Chen X., STEM attrition: College students' paths into and out of stem fields.

The environment, called Curatr, utilised the notion of game-like behaviours, colloquially known as 'gamification', to shape learners behaviour towards participating in social and collaborative learning activities, such as commenting, sharing and peer-marking. In the case study described, 33 students made 6,152 contributions during a six-month part-time online continuing education course. Findings suggest that the number of 'experience points' a student earns on the platform is highly correlated with the average assignment mark they achieve (r = 0.499 n = 33). The results suggest that gamification can help improve the learning experience and the resulting performance for groups of students. There are limitations to this finding. Within the group there are cases where contribution and resulting performance do not correlate. Further work assessing the quality of contributions is suggested to understand this effect better. © 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",Cognitive presence; Computer-supported collaborative learning; E-learning; Gamification; Web-based learning,Computer aided instruction; Students; Websites; Cognitive presence; Collaborative e-Learning; Collaborative learning activities; Collaborative learning environment; Computer Supported Collaborative Learning; Continuing education; Gamification; Web based learning; E-learning,,,,,,,"Study: Universal Music, (2012); Bloom B.S., The 2 Sigma problem: The search for methods of group instruction as effective as one-to-one tutoring, Educational Researcher, 13, 6, pp. 4-16, (1984); Burke B., Says by 2015, More Than 50 Percent of Organizations That Manage Innovation Processes Will Gamify Those Processes, (2011); Cheng C.K., Pare D.E., Collimore L., Joordens S., Assessing the effectiveness of a voluntary online discussion forum on improving students' course performance, Computers & Education, 56, 1, pp. 253-261, (2011); Cho H., Gay G., Davidson B., Ingraffea A., Social networks communication styles, and learning performance in a CSCL community, Computers & Education, 49, 2, pp. 309-329, (2005); Cordova D.I., Lepper M.R., Intrinsic motivation and the process of learning: Beneficial effects of contextualization personalization, and choice, Journal of Educational Psychology, 88, 4, pp. 715-730, (1996); Darabi A., Arrastia M.C., Nelson D.W., Cornille T., Liang X., Cognitive presence in asynchronous online learning: A comparison of four discussion strategies, Journal of Computer Assisted Learning, 27, 3, pp. 216-227, (2011); De Freitas S., Immersive Worlds: A Review of Game Based Learning, JISC Research Report, (2006); Deci E.L., Ryan R.M., The 'What' and 'Why' of goal pursuits: Human needs and the self-determination of behavior, Psychological Inquiry, 11, 4, pp. 227-268, (2000); Deterding S., Sicart M., Nacke L., O'Hara K., Dixon D., Gamification: Using game-design elements in non-gaming contexts, Part 2-Proceedings of the 2011 Annual Conference Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems, ACM, pp. 2425-2428, (2011); Egenfeldt-Nielsen S., Overview of research on the educational use of video games, Digital Kompetanse, 1, 3, pp. 184-213, (2006); Garris R., Ahlers R., Driskell J.E., Games motivation, and learning: A research and practice model, Simulation & Gaming, 33, 4, pp. 441-467, (2002); Garrison R., Cleveland-Innes M., Facilitating cognitive presence in online learning: Interaction is not enough, The American Journal of Distance Education, 19, 3, pp. 133-148, (2005); Garrison R., Anderson T., Archer W., Critical thinking and computer conferencing: A model and tool to assess cognitive presence, American Journal of Distance Education, 15, 1, pp. 7-23, (2001); Graham A., Statistics, (1999); Kanuka H., Rourke L., Laflamme E., The influence of instructional methods on the quality of online discussion, British Journal of Educational Technology, 38, 2, pp. 260-271, (2007); Kapp K.M., The Gamification of Learning and Instruction: Game-based Methods and Strategies for Training and Education, (2012); Malone T., Toward a theory of intrinsically motivating instruction, Cognitive Science, 4, 5, pp. 333-369, (1981); McClure S.M., Ericson K.M., Laibson D.I., Loewenstein G., Cohen J.D., Time discounting for primary rewards, The Journal of Neuroscience, 27, 21, pp. 5796-5804, (2007); McClure S.M., Laibson D.I., Loewenstein G., Cohen J.D., Separate neural systems value immediate and delayed monetary rewards, Science, 306, 5695, pp. 503-507, (2004); Michinov N., Brunot S., Le Bohec O., Juhel J., Delaval M., Procrastination participation, and performance in online learning environments, Computers & Education, 56, 1, pp. 243-252, (2011); Moore M.G., Editorial: Three types of interaction, The American Journal of Distance Education, 3, 2, pp. 1-6, (1989); Palmer S., Holt D., Bray S., Does the discussion help?

ARG (Alternate Reality Games) offer a new highly immersive tool that can be implemented in educational achievements. One of the strongest points of these immersive games is based on applying the sum of students participating efforts and resources (so called collective intelligence) for problem resolution. In addition, ARG combine online and offline platforms a factor that improves the realism on the game experience. In this regard, this present work aims to summarise ARG potentialities, limitations and challenges of these immersive games in higher and further education context. In terms of methodology, this research draws from an appropriate theoretical corpus and, analyses the educational potential of AGR that, in fields like marketing or corporate communication, has already started successfully, but it has still not been studied in depth in education. This study compiles, also, best practices developed in several subjects and academic degrees all around the world and not easily traceable. It concludes that, given the antecedents, potentialities and the exposed analysis, the possibility of incorporating alternate reality games into the university teaching practice in the frame of an educational strategy that determines its aims and more suitable system of evaluation, has to be considered.",Co-creation; Collective intelligence; Competences; Creativity; Game-based learning; Gamification; Higher education; Immersive games,,,,,,,,"Altbach P.G., Reisberg L., Rumbley L.E., Trends in Global Higher Education: Tracking an Academic Revolution, (2009); ARG in Education & Training, (2009); (2008); Arrojo-Balina M.J., Algo más que juegos de realidad alternativa: 'The Truth about Marika', 'Conspiracy for Good' y 'Altminds'.

One particular approach, known as gamification, seeks to improve student engagement by transforming the traditional classroom experience into a competitive multiplayer game. Initial attempts at classroom gamification relied on the teacher manually tracking student progress. At the US Air Force Academy, we wanted to experiment with a software gamification tool. Our client/server suite, dubbed Classroom Live, streamlines the gamification process for the teacher by simplifying common tasks. Simultaneously, the tool provides students with an esthetically pleasing user interface that offers in game rewards in exchange for their participation. Classroom Live is still in development, but our initial experience using the tool has been extremely positive and confirms our belief that students respond positively to gamification, even at the undergraduate level. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",education technology; gamification; interactive software; role playing game; student engagement; teaching methods,,,,,,,,"Annetta L.A., Minogue J., Holmes S.Y., Cheng M., Investigating the impact of video games on high school students' engagement and learning about genetics, Computers & Education, 53, pp. 74-85, (2009); Bertoli B., How one teacher turned sixth grade into an MMO, (2012); Cohen A.M., The gamification of education, 45, pp. 16-17, (2011); Corcoran E., The ""Gamification"" of education, (2010); Dickey M.D., Game design and learning: A conjectural analysis of how massively multiple online role-playing games (MMORPGs) foster intrinsic motivation, Educational Technology Research and Development, 55, pp. 253-273, (2006); Dondlinger M.J., Educational video game design: A review of the literature, Journal of Applied Educational Technology, 4, pp. 21-31, (2007); Essential facts about the computer and video game industry, (2012); Jensen M., Engaging the learner: Gamification strives to keep the user's interest, 66, pp. 40-44, (2012); Kapp K.M., Games, gamification, and the quest for learner engagement, 66, pp. 64-68, (2012); Markey K., St Leeder C., Jean B., Student's behavior playing an online information literacy game, Journal of Information Literacy, 5, pp. 46-65, (2011); Prensky M., Digital natives, digital immigrants, On The Horizon, 9, pp. 1-6, (2001); Rosas R., Nussbaum M., Cunsille P., Marianov V., Correa M., Flores P., Salinas M., Beyond Nintendo: Design and assessment of educational video games for first and second grade students, Computers & Education, 40, pp. 71-94, (2003); Ross M., Case study: Math teacher uses gamification to help at-risk students succeed, (2010); Salen K., Torres R., Wolozin L., Rufo-Tepper R., Shapiro A., Quest to learn: Developing the school for digital kids, (2011); Swan C., Gamification: A new way to shape behavior, Communication World, 29, pp. 13-14, (2012); Teel S., Schweitzer D., Fulton S., Braingame: A web based student response system, The Journal of Computing Sciences in Colleges, 28, pp. 40-46, (2012)","A.

Playing is explored here, considering changes in student approaches to leisure, recreation and having fun and investigates how playing in general is changing. The purpose of this paper summarizes two scenarios about the playing domain from the Student Needs 2025+ project and highlights implications for the future of higher education. Design/methodology/approach: A modified version of the University of Houston’s “Framework Foresight” method was used to explore the future of six aspects of future student life. Findings: Play has gotten serious. It is increasingly scheduled, supervised and often includes some larger objective, such as learning. This purposeful play is spreading into virtual space as well, which will increasingly be the setting for play. In the longer term, play – in the form or gamification – is likely to integrate into more and more of student life. Games and play will be used for teaching in the classroom (real and virtual), at work for training, to make exercise “fun”, and even in civic life for encouraging greater participation in governance. Research limitations/implications: In terms of research limitations, the paper is focused on the needs of students and does not purport to be an exhaustive analysis of all the issues influencing higher education. It views the future of higher education through the lens of students and their emerging needs. Practical implications: The paper is intended for educators, researchers and administrators to provide insight on how the needs of students, their key customers, are evolving. Originality/value: This research explores student life in its totality as way to more accurately identify student needs in the future. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Games; Gamification; Higher education; Playing; Recreation; Student needs,,,,,,,,,"L.

In order to perform this study, the interaction of a set of users enrolled in a course within the iMOOC platform has been analyzed, in which MOOC courses are implemented based on concepts like connectivism, collaborative learning, gamification or adaptivity. Specifically, this study deals with obtaining information about the discussions that take place in learning communities created using social networks like Google+ and Twitter in parallel of the activities performed inside the iMOOC platform. Through this information, this paper tries to distinguish the types of learning that occurs in those discussions (non-formal and informal learning), estimating also how users interact with tagged content in social networks, and how that allows students -users- to continue or create conversations that help to expand or strengthen the content they treated during the MOOC course. © 2015 IEEE.",Collaborative Learning; eLearning; Google+; iMOOC; Informal Learning; MOOC; Non-formal Learning; Twitter,Curricula; E-learning; Education; Collaborative learning; Google; iMOOC; Informal learning; MOOC; Non-formal learning; Twitter; Social networking (online),,,,,,,"Garcia-Penalvo F.J., Seoane Pardo A.M., Una revision actualizada del concepto de eLearning.

Integrating game-like design elements into educational context has the potential to increase students' motivation and improve students' academic outcome. Empirical studies on gamification have tested how one or several game design elements could influence student learning, motivation, and participation. There is a lack of empirical research on evaluating the effectiveness of a complete gamification design model. We propose to extend their research by developing a gamification design model based on motivation theories and empirical findings. We will then field test this design model in three university-level courses. The purpose of this research is twofold: first, to examine the effectiveness of this gamification design model, and second, to develop a deeper understanding on the impact of gamification on students' motivation, academic outcome, and participation.",Design; Gamification; Learning; Motivation; Participation,Curricula; Design; Education; Education computing; Motivation; Educational context; Empirical findings; Empirical research; Empirical studies; Gamification; Learning; Motivation theories; Participation; Students,,,,,,,"Abramovich S., Schunn C., Higashi R.M., Are badges useful in education?: It depends upon the type of badge and expertise of learner, Educational Technology Research and Development, 61, pp. 217-232, (2013); Anderson A., Huttenlocher D., Kleinberg J., Leskovec J., Engaging with massive online courses, Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on World Wide Web, (2014); Barata G., Gama S., Jorge J., Goncalves D., Improving participation and learning with gamification, Proceedings of the Gamification'13, (2013); Gamification 101: An Introduction to the use of Game Dynamics to Influence Behavior, (2010); Christy K.R., Fox J., Leaderboards in a virtual classroom: A test of stereotype threat and social comparison explanations for women's math performance, Computers & Education, (2014); Csikszentmihalyi M., Intrinsic rewards and emergent motivation, The Hidden Costs of Reward, pp. 205-216, (1978); Deci E.L., Ryan R.M., The ""what"" and ""why"" of goal pursuits: Human needs and the self-determination of behavior, Psychological Inquiry, 11, 4, pp. 227-268, (2000); Denny P., The effect of virtual achievements on student engagement, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, (2013); Deterding S., Dixon D., Khaled R., Nacke L., From game design elements to gamefulness: Defining gamification, Proceedings of the 15th International Academic MindTrek Conference: Envisioning Future Media Environments, pp. 9-15, (2011); 7 Things You Should Know About Gamification, (2011); Festinger L., A theory of social comparison processes, Human Relations, 7, 2, pp. 117-140, (1954); Gage N., Berliner D., Educational Psychology, (1998); Ibanez M.B., Di-Serio A., Delgado-Kloos C., Gamification for engaging computer science students in learning activities: A case study, IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies, 3, (2014); Iosup A., Epema D., An experience report on using gamification in technical higher education, Proceedings of the 45th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education, pp. 27-32, (2014); Locke E.A., Latham G.P., A Theory of Goal Setting and Task Performance, (1990); Nicholson S., A user-centered theoretical framework for meaningful gamification, Proceedings of Games+ Learning+Society, 8, (2012); Nicholson S., Exploring gamification techniques for classroom management, Paper Presented at the Games+ Learning+ Society 9.0 Conference, (2013); O'Donovan S., Gain J., Marais P., A case study in the gamification of a university-level games development course, Proceedings of the South African Institute for Computer Scientists and Information Technologists Conference, pp. 242-251, (2013); Salen K., Zimmerman E., Rules of Play: Game Design Fundamentals, (2004); Schunk D.H., Goal setting and self-efficacy during self-regulated learning, Educational Psychologist, 25, 1, pp. 71-86, (1990)",,Chen W.; Biswas G.; Gu X.; Ogata H.; Kong S.C.; Qiu F.; Chang B.; Chen W.,Asia-Pacific Society for Computers in Education,,"23rd International Conference on Computers in Education, ICCE 2015",30 November 2015 through 4 December 2015,Hangzhou,122192,,978-499080149-6,,,English,"Dr. Stud.

The conceptual design of MEIO aims to foster the objectives of environmental education according to Tbilisi Declaration, to wit, awareness, knowledge, attitudes, skills and participation, in urban communities. The main goal is to encourage people to engage in denouncing and even solving (by themselves) environmental issues. MEIO bears clear similarities with urban navigation tools such as Waze, but instead of guiding drivers, it allows users to point out abnormalities such as water pollution, fire, etc. which become visible in an online map. A voting mechanism of the best actions realized by users leads to virtual rewards, this is the gamification component of our tool.

We present a study in which a college course was gamified, by including experience points, levels, badges, challenges and leaderboards. The study was five years long, where the first three were non-gamified years, and the last two regarded two successive experiments of our gamified approach. To assess how gamification impacted the learning experience, we compared data from both gamified and non-gamified years, using different performance measures. Results show significant improvements in terms of attention to reference materials, online participation and proactivity. They also suggest that our approach can reduce grade discrepancies among students and help them score better. Modeling course activities with game challenges and properly distributing those over the term seem to enhance this effect.

After a brief prior familiarization with the main features of learning and educational paradigms in the twenty-first century as well as with effective teaching strategies and pedagogical methodologies in such a context, it will move towards the clarification of the meaning of the aforementioned terms and other related concepts in what might be called the framework of playful learning. Straightaway, a detailed description of the main applicable strategies to develop an effective gamified proposal will be offered. These playful techniques have a significant ability to influence learners' motivation and strengthen their commitment to training projects while their participation, engagement, curiosity, fantasy and desire for adventures are stimulated and developed. They also have plenty of remarkable chances in the field of behavioral modeling, a topic also discussed in the chapter and whose applications within Education, and in any other economic or social area, are numerous and varied. The final level of this challenge is an exploration of the key game-based design elements (aesthetics, dynamics, mechanics and components) to close the overview of the landscape that is presented. © 2014 by IGI Global.

These competitions are often regarded as excellent approaches to learn deeply technical concepts in a fun, non-traditional learning environment, but there are many difficulties associated with developing and competing in a CTF event that are rarely discussed that counteract these benefits. CTF competitions often have issues related to participation, quality assurance, and confusing challenges. These problems affect the overall quality of a CTF competition and describe how effective they are at catalyzing learning and assessing skill. In this paper, we present insights and lessons learned from organizing CSAW CTF, one of the largest and most successful CTFs. © 2014 USENIX Summit on Gaming, Games, and Gamification in Security Education, 3GSE 2014.

We argue that the reflection of design components and aesthetical structures are relevant also for younger students. In order to foster the perception of formal structures and raise awareness of different design qualities, we consider a pragmatic approach. This approach encourages experimental exploration and creative activities. We pursue a concept of gamification, which enables playful participation based on the freedom of exploration. It is assumed that a playful activity involving film design components as variable structures can enhance an aesthetic and therefore more abstract perception of the presented film plots. The core concept behind the educational application is built upon an interactive storytelling tool, which allows the creation of different variations of the same story. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",Aesthetic education; Film design; Gamification; Interactive storytelling; Pragmatic didactics,Computer aided instruction; Design; Education; Human computer interaction; Motion pictures; Educational Applications; Educational approach; Film design; Gamification; Interactive learning environment; Interactive storytelling; Pragmatic didactics; Variable structures; Students,,,,,Furtwangen University; Institute for Media and Communication of Baden-Württemberg,The project is realized at Furtwangen University and supported by the Institute for Media and Communication of Baden-Württemberg.

Although gamification has been applied in several contexts including business, marketing, corporate management, and online communities and social networks, little research has been conducted on the application of gamification to engineering lab activities, nor is there empirical evidence to support the effectiveness of gamification at motivating and engaging students. For this study, two types of websites were created to collect data from students who enrolled an undergraduate introduction to human factors course taught at The Pennsylvania State University in the fall of 2015 semester. The two types of websites were Gamification (GM) and Non-Gamification (NG). While the GM website included game elements such as a Badge System, Score, Avatar, Leaderboard, Level, and Feedback (Notification), the NG website was a traditional website without game elements. In these websites, students could create their own multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and answer questions authored by classmates. The results suggest that the gamification of engineering lab activities had a positive effect in terms of motivation, engagement, and performance, indicated by the higher number of students who joined the GM website, the number of answers submitted by the GM group, the number of distinct days of participation, and the score of exam for the GM group. Thus, we can conclude that a positive effect of gamification on student learning in engineering lab activities was ultimately found. © 2016 IEEE.",Engineering education; Gamification; Learning,Education;

Aspects of gamification are now applied across many areas of life - business, health, politics, and community. The gamification of the consumer and social web already provides many examples where game concepts have been integrated in nongame contexts in order to engage and motivate users and enrich their online experiences. A well-designed gamification strategy within online education seeks to translate these positive experiences to further encourage and enhance the student learning experience. The core elements of games (rules, feedback systems, and voluntary participation) are integrated into the learning activities. As technology enhanced learning becomes a pivotal component of educational practice, learning experiences are increasingly designed to include online and digital elements. Mobile web-enabled devices are a natural complement to this transition, enabling new ways for students to interact with subject material. The nature and capabilities of these devices further enables the possibilities of gamifying learning activities by unobtrusively encouraging and motivating the student in a familiar context. The successful integration of a gamified learning experience requires it to be part of a well-defined plan that promotes collaboration, research, systems-thinking, and problem-solving skills. Overall, the gamification strategy must align with the desired learning outcomes and avoid detracting from the core learning activity. In the future, the proliferation of gamification will continue within education and beyond - with the potential to engage, motivate, and build new collaborative, cross-disciplinary communities. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.

To address this lack and to provide learners with more versatile opportunities to communicate amongst each other, by sharing, assessing and co-constructing their knowledge, we designed an APP based on a highly interactive, ubiquitous and constructive learning approach. This means that learning contents are not just being delivered to our learners but, instead of this, they are being integrated into versatile tasks that although individually performed, affect the community of learners. The current paper presents our first experience using the Guess it! Language Trainer APP. Firstly, we detail how the APP was used to support students' language learning outside the classroom, secondly, how it helped learners to get actively involved in their own learning process by adding themselves content to the knowledge base, and thirdly, we show how the data on students' usage of the APP and participation in the learning process is used to automate the assessment of different competences by the language instructor. A pre-posttest comparison showed very good results on students' language acquisition. This is complemented with the analysis of the system logs that highlight firstly, that students dedicated to playing the APP much longer time than we estimate they usually employ for independent learning and secondly, that they significantly improved their learning outcomes whilst using the APP. Additionally, other objective indicators on proficiency of other skills such as the ability to explain terms in a foreign language or the competence to assess definitions of mates were obtained automatically.",APPs; Foreign languages; Gamification; Mobile learning; Peerassessment,Application programs; E-learning; Ecology; Ecosystems; Education; Knowledge based systems; Students; Teaching; Community of learners; Constructive learning; Foreign language; Foreign language learning; Gamification; Independent learning; Mobile Learning; Peer assessment; Learning systems,,,,,,,"Agudo J.E., Rico M., Sanchez H., Valor M., Accessing mobile learning records in Moodle through web services, IEEE-RITA, 6, 3, pp. 95-102, (2011); Bellotti F., Kapralos B., Lee K., Moreno-Ger P., Berta R., Assessment in and of serious games: An overview, Advances in Human-Computer Interaction, (2013); Berns A., Gonzalez-Pardo A., Camacho D., Game-like language learning in 3-D virtual environments, Computers & Education, 60, 1, pp. 210-220, (2013); Berns A., Palomo-Duarte M., Dodero J.M., Valero-Franco C., Using a 3D online game to assess students' foreign language acquisition and communicative competence, Proceedings of the 8th European Conference, on Technology Enhanced Learning (EC-TEL, 8095, pp. 19-31, (2013); Berns A., Palomo Duarte M., Dodero J.M., Perez Zurera M., Mobile APPs and games to foster students' writing competences, Research Challenges in CALL.

As educators are left to balance more limited time available between patient care and resident education, new methods to augment traditional graduate medical education are needed.; Objectives: To assess acceptance and use of a novel gamification-based medical knowledge software among internal medicine residents and to determine retention of information presented to participants by this medical knowledge software.; Methods: We designed and developed software using principles of gamification to deliver a web-based medical knowledge competition among internal medicine residents at the University of Alabama (UA) at Birmingham and UA at Huntsville in 2012–2013. Residents participated individually and in teams. Participants accessed daily questions and tracked their online leaderboard competition scores through any internet-enabled device. We completed focus groups to assess participant acceptance and analysed software use, retention of knowledge and factors associated with loss of participants (attrition).; Results: Acceptance: In focus groups, residents (n=17) reported leaderboards were the most important motivator of participation. Use: 16 427 questions were completed: 28.8% on Saturdays/Sundays, 53.1% between 17:00 and 08:00. Retention of knowledge: 1046 paired responses (for repeated questions) were collected. Correct responses increased by 11.9% (p<0.0001) on retest. Differences per time since question introduction, trainee level and style of play were observed. Attrition: In ordinal regression analyses, completing more questions (0.80 per 10% increase; 0.70 to 0.93) decreased, while postgraduate year 3 class (4.25; 1.44 to 12.55) and non-daily play (4.51; 1.50 to 13.58) increased odds of attrition.; Conclusions: Our software-enabled, gamification-based educational intervention was well accepted among our millennial learners. Coupling software with gamification and analysis of trainee use and engagement data can be used to develop strategies to augment learning in time-constrained educational settings. © 2014, BMJ Publishing Group.

Thus, structural readjustment of the teaching organization is urgently needed. Increasing proportions of gamifying teaching and experiencing teaching is an effective way to solve this problem. However, only a few studies have discussed the gamification of teaching reform in colleges. To improve the effectiveness of teaching and increase the participation of students in classrooms, the teaching reform idea and scheme of gamifying teaching and experiencing teaching were discussed in a course entitled Layout and Management of Distribution Center. The teaching reform aims to integrate comprehensive gamifying into the teaching of an entire curriculum. Specifically, small games are designed in each class during the early period to help the students learn the corresponding knowledge in games. A game-driven model of curriculum design was proposed and applied in teaching reform practice of Shijiazhuang Posts and Telecommunications Technical College. Results demonstrated that gamification of teaching reform achieves outstanding effects. Students participate in classroom activities positively, and all evaluation indexes improve year by year. Results confirm that teachers need to pay attention to systemization, gamification, and immersion of teaching design, and ensure the attractiveness and acceptability of the teaching method.",Experiencing teaching; Gamification; Sand table teaching; Teaching reform,Curricula; Education computing; Gamification; Students; Warehouses; Classroom activity; Curriculum designs; Distribution centers; Evaluation index; Higher vocational educations; Higher vocational schools; Teaching reforms; Technical college; Teaching,,,,,,,"Hanus M.D., Fox J., Assessing the effects of gamification in the classroom: a longitudinal study on intrinsic motivation, social comparison, satisfaction, effort, and academic performance, Computers & Education, 80, 80, pp. 152-161, (2015); Attali Y., Arieli-Attali M., Gamification in assessment: do points affect test performance?, Computers & Education, 83, 83, pp. 57-63, (2015); Dominguez A., Saenz-De-Navarrete J., De-Marcos L., Fernandez-Sanz L., Pages C., Martinez-Herraiz J.J., Gamifying learning experiences: practical implications and outcomes, Computers & Education, 63, 63, pp. 380-392, (2013); Cheong C., Cheong F., Filippou J.Q.Q., A Gamified Approach for Enhancing Learning, Pacific Asia Conference on Information Systems, pp. 1-14, (2013); Jinlei Z., Baohui W., Research on applications of gamification learning idea in flipped classroom, Distance Education Journal, 31, 1, pp. 73-78, (2013); Dewey J., Democracy and education: An introduction to the philosophy of education, (1916); Conrad D., Hedin D., The impact of experimental education on adolescent development, Child & Youth Services, 4, 3-4, pp. 57-76, (1982); Smith T.E., Roland C.C., Havens M.D., Hoyt J.A., The theory and practice of challenge education, (1992); Kolb D.A., Experiential Learning: Experience As the Source of Learning and Development, (2008); Jinhua Z., Lei Y., Research review on experiencing teaching, Heilongjiang Researches on Higher Education, 6, pp. 143-145, (2010); Deterding S., Dan D., Khaled R., Nacke L., From game design elements to gamefulness: defining 'gamification, International Academic Mindtrek Conference: Envisioning Future Media Environments (ACM), pp. 9-15, (2011); Kapp K.M., The gamification of learning and instruction: game-based methods and strategies for training and education.

New pedagogical methodologies have been proposed to inspire and motivate students while training to become professionals in the engineering field. One of them, gamification, is based on the use of game design elements in non-game contexts, like learning environments. Several studies have dealt with the use of gamification in engineering courses, 87% of them reporting that their implementation had some degree of positive outcome. This paper shows the experience of game-based learning applied to a Graphical Engineering course in the second year of the Mechanical Engineering curriculum at a Spanish university. Several activities were developed during the academic course, in which students had to face different kind of tasks: competitions, simulations, research tournaments, pokes, social forums, survey games, etc. As participation was voluntary in most cases, the current study is focused on the individual perception of the students, rather than on the overall learning outcomes of the group. The results of this experience based on “Learning by playing” have been positive, according to lecturers and students’ perception. The number of students considering the game-based activates as beneficial or entertaining is between 3 to 10 times higher than those who think the opposite. The main advantages of gamification have been, thus, increasing the attending ratio of the class, enhancing the interest for the topics of the lectures, bringing fun and joy to the classroom and giving more initiative to the students. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Drawing; Gamification; Graphical Engineering; Representation; Teaching,Computer aided instruction; Engineering education; Game design; Students; Design elements; Drawing; Engineering course; Engineering fields; Game design; Gamification; Graphical engineering; Learning by playing; Learning environments; Representation; Teaching,,,,,,,"Bodnar C.A., Anastasio D., Enszer J.A., Burkey D.D., Engineers at Play: Games as Teaching Tools for Undergraduate Engineering Students, Journal of Engineering Education, 105, pp. 147-200, (2016); Zichermann G., Cunningham C., Gamification by Design: Implementing Game Mechanics in Web and Mobile Apps, (2011); Herger M., Gamification in Human Resources, Enterprise Gamification, 3, (2014); Herzig P., Strahringer S., Ameling M., Gamification of ERP Systems – Exploring Gamification Effects on User Acceptance Constructs; Hamari J., Koivisto J., Working out for likes: An empirical study on social influence in exercise gamification, Computers in Human Behavior, 50, pp. 333-347, (2015); Schroeter R., Oxtoby J., Johnson D., AR and Gamification Concepts to Reduce Driver Boredom and Risk Taking Behaviours, Proceedings of the 6Th International Conference on Automotive User Interfaces and Interactive Vehicular Applications, pp. 1-8, (2014); Zichermann G., Rethinking Elections with Gamification, (2012); Park H.J., Bae J.H., Study and Research of Gamification Design, International Journal of Software Engineering & Its Applications, 8, 8, pp. 19-27, (2014); Crown S.W., Improving visualization skills of engineering graphics students using simple javascript web based games, Journal of Engineering Education, 90, 3, pp. 347-355, (2001); Chen H., Chen L., Chen J., Xu J., Research on mobile learning games in engineering graphics education, Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering, 269, pp. 2981-2986, (2013); Stizmann T., A meta-analytic examination of instructional effectiveness of computer based simulation games, Personnel Psychology, 64, 2, pp. 489-528, (2011); Shaffer D.W., Halverson R., Squire K.R., Gee J.P., Video Games and the Future of Learning.

Design/methodology/approach: Dietrich et al. (2017) six-step framework was applied to a co-design project involving four groups of 14- to 16-year-old Australian high school students. Data collection included observations by three facilitators, written feedback from members of each group and video presentations of the generated ideas. The data analysis focused on investigating the applicability of the six-step framework to young consumers and evaluating the quality and practicality of the generated ideas. Findings: Sensitization is key to enabling young consumers to become equal participants during the co-design process. Sensitization allowed the participants to engage in the design task in a playful manner, which fostered active participation and creative insights during the co-design session. A team approach based on interactivity and group autonomy enabled adolescents to contribute insights into their specific needs and wants. This was complemented by a trusting environment and the presence of immediately available yet “hands off” facilitators. Research limitations/implications: The findings are limited to one specific sample and design task. Future research is required that investigates co-design with young consumers in different contexts. Practical implications: This paper provides guidance for the application of co-design with young consumers by highlighting the importance of sensitization and facilitation. Originality/value: This study marks one of the first approaches to co-designing alcohol education programs, including VR components, with young consumers. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the consequences of involving young consumers through co-design. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Adolescents; Alcohol education; Co-design; Gamification; Service design,,,,,,,,"Alhabash S., Mcalister A., Quilliam T., Richards J., Lou C., Alcohol’s getting a bit more social: when alcohol marketing messages on Facebook increase young adults’ intentions to imbibe, Mass Communication and Society, 18, 3, pp. 350-375, (2015); Baker S.M., Gentry J.W., Rittenburg T.L., Building understanding of the domain of consumer vulnerability, Journal of Macromarketing, 25, 2, pp. 128-139, (2005); Barko T., Sadler T.D., Practicality in virtuality: finding student meaning in video game education, Journal of Science Education and Technology, 22, 2, pp. 124-132, (2012); Chaplin L.N., Hill R.P., John D.R., Poverty and materialism: a look at impoverished versus affluent children, Journal of Public Policy & Marketing, 33, 1, pp. 78-92, (2014); Deterding S., Dixon D., Khaled R., Nacke L., From game design elements to gamefulness: defining gamification, pp. 9-15, (2011); Dietrich T., Rundle-Thiele S., Leo C., Connor J.P., One size (never) fits all: segment differences observed following a school-based alcohol social marketing program, Journal of School Health, 85, 4, pp. 251-259, (2015); Dietrich T., Rundle-Thiele S., Schuster L., Connor J.P., Co-designing social marketing programs, Journal of Social Marketing, 6, 1, pp. 41-61, (2016); Dietrich T., Trischler J., Schuster L., Rundle-Thiele S., Co-designing services with vulnerable consumers, Journal of Service Theory and Practice, 27, 3, pp. 663-688, (2017); Donetto S., Pierri P., Tsianakas V., Robert G., Experience-based co-design and healthcare improvement: realizing participatory design in the public sector, Design Journal, 18, 2, pp. 227-248, (2015); Druin A., The role of children in the design of new technology, Behaviour & Information Technology, 21, 1, pp. 1-25, (2002); Edvardsson B., Gustafsson A., Roos I., Service portraits in service research: a critical review, International Journal of Service Industry Management, 16, 1, pp. 107-121, (2005); Elg M., Engstrom J., Witell L., Poksinska B., Co-creation and learning in health-care service development, Journal of Service Management, 23, 3, pp. 328-343, (2012); Engstrom J., Elg M., A self-determination theory perspective on customer participation in service development, Journal of Services Marketing, 29, 6-7, pp. 511-521, (2015); Foxcroft D.R., Tsertsvadze A., Universal school-based prevention programs for alcohol misuse in young people, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 5, (2011); Gustafsson A., Kristensson P., Witell L., Customer co-creation in service innovation: a matter of communication?, Journal of Service Management, 23, 3, pp. 311-327, (2012); Hamari J., Koivisto J., Sarsa H., Does gamification work?

Parvan 2, Timisoara, 300223, Romania","A modern and successful tackle on education is represented by new teaching techniques which imply online courses, collaborative assignments, dynamic grading systems, real-time feedback and motivational inserts into the process of learning. Elearning together with massive open online courses (MOOCs) have seen a recent rise in popularity and integrate many of the aspects that enable distant students to take part in higher levels of education. While the perspective of migrating towards a pure online environment is in line with the trend of the younger generations, most professional and intellectual skills can only be effectively learned through physical attendance and practical guided work. Yet, the main concern highlighted in this paper is the weak point of most classic educational systems: the constant decreasing motivation it gives students - individuals who have grown and are embedded in many virtual realities form where they draw the needed intrinsic motivation and energy. To overcome this limitation, we introduce an educational platform named Gamified, which simplifies the educational and grading systems in modern schools and universities. It relies on the fundamental aspects of the theory of Gamification, namely bringing motivational elements from (video) games into non-game contexts. It does this through the abandonment of grades (seen by us as negative feedback, a demotivator), and integration of heroes, accumulated experience, levels, level-ups, achievements, quests, guilds, and other representative elements taken from role-playing games (positive feedback at different levels of motivation). Not only do these elements sound familiar to a vast majority of todays students, but they also trigger interest in the new approach to learning. We validate this technique over a period of 3 years on different generations of college students, compare the results with control groups, a present what we believe is remarkable feedback - both in terms of grades and participation, as well as in student attitude towards learning. © 2017 The Author(s).",educational platform; eLearning; gamification; motivation; persuasive technology,E-learning; Education; Embedded systems; Feedback; Grading; Knowledge based systems; Motivation; Online systems; Real time systems; Teaching; Virtual reality; Educational platforms; Educational systems; Gamification; Intrinsic motivation; Massive open online course; Online environments; Persuasive technology; Process of learning; Students,,,,,"NOVAMOOC; National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation; Corporation for National and Community Service, CNCS; Unitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii, UEFISCDI, (PN-II-RU-TE-2014-4-2040)","This work was partially supported by a grant of the Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation, CNCS - UEFISCDI, project number PN-II-RU-TE-2014-4-2040: NOVAMOOC - Development and innovative implementation of MOOCs in Higher Education.","Hamari J., Transforming homo economicus into homo ludens: A field experiment on gamification in a utilitarian peer-to-peer trading service, Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, 12, 4, pp. 236-245, (2013); Boumova V., Traditional Vs.

The course followed the xMOOC model based on a well-defined sequence of learning content, mainly video lectures and interactive self-tests, and with heavy reliance on social collaboration features. From 2726 active participants, 38% have participated in a survey at the end of the course. This paper presents an analysis of the survey responses with respect to the following questions: 1) How can a MOOC accommodate different learning styles and 2) What recommendations for the design and organization of a MOOC can be concluded from the responses? We finally give an outlook on challenges for the further development of openHPI. Those challenges are based on didactical and technical affordances for a better support of the different learning styles. We propose an evolution of the xMOOC, that bridges the gap to the cMOOC model by developing tools that allow users to create diverging paths through the learning material, involve the user personally in the problem domain with (group) hands-on exercises and reward user contributions by means of gamification. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.",active learning; culture of participation; gamification; learning styles; massive open online courses,Curricula; Surveys; Active Learning; Gamification; Hands-on exercise; Higher education; Learning contents; Learning materials; Learning Style; Massive open online course; E-learning,,,,,,,"Bliss J., Light P., Shaljho R., Learning Sites: Social and Technological Resources for Learning, (1999); Deterding S., Dixon D., Khaled R., Nacke L., From game design elements to gamefulness: Defining "" gamification, Proceedings of the 15th International Academic MindTrek Conference: Envisioning Future Media Environments, MindTrek 2011, Tampere, Finland, pp. 9-15, (2011); Dick H., Zietz J., Cultures of Participation als eine Persuasive Technologie, Icom, 9, 2, pp. 9-15, (2011); Fischer F., Bruhn J., Grasel C., Mandl H., Fostering collaborative knowledge construction with visualization tools, Learning and Instruction, 12, 2, (2002); Fischer G., Understanding, Fostering, and Supporting Cultures of Participation, Interactions, 80, 3, pp. 42-53, (2011); Grunewald F., Mazandarani E., Meinel C., Teusner R., Totschnig M., Willems C., openHPI - A Case-Study on the Emergence of two Learning Communities, IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (2013); Kimmerle J., Cress U., Group awareness and self-presentation in computersupported information exchange, International Journal of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning, 3, 1, pp. 85-97, (2007); Kolb D., Experiential Learning: Experience As the Source of Learning and Development, (1984); McAuley A., Stewart B., Siemens G., Cormier D., The MOOC Model for Digital Practice, (2012); Olofsson A.D., Lindberg J.O., Whatever happened to the social dimension?

Taking as a starting point a reflection about the concept of gamification, the experience of design and implementation of an online platform is presented, El Palabrero, enliven in a pre-Hispanic world of fiction whose purpose is to administer a game experience around the different types of argumentation as a classroom tool for language teachers. Five moments were proposed for the development of the research: (1) A phase of needs definition with Spanish Language Department professors and students taking the Oral-written Expression course at Universidad Autónoma de Occidente; (2) an exploration of the concept of gamification and an approach for its definition; (3) the design of the experience according to the established requirements; (4) implementation of the first model of the gamification methodology; and (5) validation of the gamification proposal with first semester students and Spanish language professors. A methodology for the creation of gamification projects in five stages was designed as a result of this process: Analysis, gamification, formalization, mediation, and packaging.

The benefits of using SRSs in terms of attendance, attention, participation, or motivation have been shown in many studies. Moreover, several studies demonstrate that the use of some kind of gaming techniques in education are useful to stimulate students to learn in wider, longer, and deeper ways. This paper analyzes whether the integration of both SRSs and gaming techniques leads to better results in motivation, attention, engagement, and learning performance than SRSs alone. For this purpose, a new tool has been developed for conducting an experimental study with students from different subjects and from different academic levels. A randomized post-test-only control group analysis was conducted to evaluate the impact of the gamified SRS. In addition, a multivariate three-way factorial design has been performed considering three relevant factors: 1) learning tool (non-gamified SRS or gamified SRS); 2) study type; and 3) gender. The main finding is that students who took lecture sessions with a gamified SRS had more positive perceptions with respect to motivation, attention, and learning performance than students who took lecture sessions with a non-gamified SRS. © 2013 IEEE.",Computer-aided instruction; gamification; student experiments; student response system (SRS),Computer aided instruction; Education; Motivation; Students; Academic level; Control groups; Factorial design; Gamification; Learning performance; Learning tool; Student experiments; Student-response system; Interactive computer systems,,,,,,,"Boghossian P., How socratic pedagogy works, Informal Logic, 23, 2, pp. 17-25, (2003); Cosgrove R., Critical thinking in the Oxford tutorial: A call for an explicit and systematic approach, High.

Inspired and intrigued by the possibilities of using game environments as learning spaces, which can lead to social changes (McGonigal, 2011), the instructional designers at the University of British Columbia ventured into the ""unknown"" and transformed a ""traditional"" online course on adult education into a role-playing game. This paper explores the notion of gamification in a higher education setting, what it means in terms of instructors' teaching practice, and how it changes student experience. The paper describes how game elements were incorporated into a course. The goals were to 1) engage students by creating a responsive feedback system, and 2) empower students by allowing them to customize the game experience based on their learning style and interest in the topics. The game space designed for the students enabled them to explore and try different things, and also realize that their work mattered. The paper focuses on the process and challenges of ""gamifying"" academic content and outlines the elements that make the game successful and sustainable. The designers purposefully avoided creating a virtual world or environment similar to an MMORPG, or investing a significant amount of funding and time into creating a space where only experienced gamers would feel comfortable. The new gamified version of the course needed to be low-tech, but enable high-social learning. The goal was to increase student engagement in the course, especially their interaction with one another, without technology getting in the way of their learning. The course was therefore taken out of the structured and formal LMS and transferred into the more flexible and social WordPress environment. The students took on two roles: 1) the role of reporters who were required to write about adult education issues and respond to different tasks set out by their Editor in Chief, and 2) the role of readers who responded to the written articles. Together, they were contributing and building the newspaper ""Adult Educator Weekly"". The design of the course enabled students to receive timely feedback from their peers, which made the students feel their writing was relevant and purposeful. Based on the students' feedback, the gamification of the course contributed to their increased interest in the topics, engagement with the course, and understanding of the issues from different perspectives.",Empowering; Engagement; Gamification; Higher education; Role-playing,Curricula; Education; Education computing; Interactive computer graphics; Teaching; Virtual reality; Empowering; Engagement; Gamification; Higher education; Role playing; Students,,,,,,,"Bogost I., Persuasive Games: The Expressive Power of Videogames, (2007); Bransford J.D., Schwartz D.L., Rethinking Transfer: A Simple Proposal With Multiple Implications, Review of Research in Education, 24, pp. 61-100, (1999); Gaible E., Amitabh D., ""Project Evaluation EVOKE"", (2010); Gee J.P., Why Video Games are Good for Your Soul: Pleasure and Learning, (2005); Gee J.P., ""Video Games & Learning.

Rooted in the motivational framework of flow experiences, gamification is a contemporary educational approach that leverages the characteristics of gaming culture. This study examined how gamification techniques were operationalized by eight professors and one director of instructional technology. The results of interviews among a purposive sample show that gamification improves learning outcomes. Subjects ranging from computer science and technology to languages and multimedia journalism are taught in classrooms on campus, online, and in hybrid settings. Game design mechanics such as points, challenges, and collaboration rank as the top three elements of gamification. Professors noted increases in student coursework completion and discussion participation; students were exposed to real life situations and had fun learning. This study addresses the gap in educational perspectives through gamification to encourage desirable behavior for the benefit of the learner community. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Engagement; Flow; Gamification; Higher education; Interaction,Computer aided instruction; Engineering education; Human computer interaction; Students; Teaching; Engagement; Flow; Gamification; Higher education; Interaction; Education,,,,,,,"McGonigal J., Reality is Broken: Why Games Make Us Better and How they Can Change the World, (2011); Sardone N.B., Devlin-Scherer R., Teacher candidate responses to digital games, J.

The lack of participation by students or eagerness to participate in class creates a challenge to understand the learning content and topics being discussed. This study aims to improve explicit participation, such as students answering questions, asking question, and openly sharing ideas with their fellow classmates. In order to achieve this, a gamified web-based system has been developed applying a design science research approach. Application of this research approach uses prototyping of a gamified web-based platform to represent proof of solution development and problem solving. Through this application, an increase in students' participation in class has been improved, by transforming a classroom into an enjoyable environment using gaming mechanics and rules. This enables students to participate more in class knowing that they will earn points that will be used to contribute to a calculated percentage of their predicate mark. Gaming mechanics such as rewards, loss, status and reputation, and feedback are incorporated into the solution development and problem solving. This is because related studies have proved that gaming mechanics take advantage of the human psychological notion of winning, which is most likely to be in a gaming environment, in the scope of this study, to win is to participate in class.",Gamification; Reward system; Students' participation in class; Web application,Education; Mechanics; Problem solving; Software prototyping; Websites; Design-science researches; Gamification; Learning contents; Research approach; Reward systems; WEB application; Web based platform; Web-based system; Students,,,,,,,"Arnold B.J., Gamification in education, Lund Journal, 3, 2005, pp. 13-17, (2013); Carlson T.B., Hastie P.A., Journal of Teaching in Physical Education, pp. 165-176, (1997); Camp W.G., Participation in Student Activities and Achievement: A Covariance Structural Analysis, pp. 272-278, (2015); Cechanowicz J., Et al., Effects of Gamification on Participation and Data Quality in A Real-Work Market Research Domain, (2013); Cronk R., Using Non-interactive Games to Increase Student Engagement and Participation in Class Discussion, (2012); Deterding S., Et al., Gamification: Using Game Design Elements in Non-Gaming Contexts, (2011); Haque M., Sampling Methods in Social Research, (2013); Huang W.H., Soman D., A Practitioner's Guide to Gamification of Education, (2013); Huotari K., Hamari J., Defining Gamification - A Service Marketing Perspective, (2012); Kernler D., Introduction to the practice of statistics, Chaper i - Other Effective Sampling Methods; Liu Y., Et al., Gamifying Intelligent Environments, (2011); Meder M., Et al., DAIKnow: A Gamified Enterprise Bookmarking System, 8416, pp. 759-762, (2014); Moore D.M., Taylor C.D., Student Participation, Interaction, and Regulation in A Computer-Mediated Communication Environment: A Qualitative Study, (1996); Muntean C.I., Raising Engagement in E-learning Through Gamification, (2011); Nicholson S., A User-Centered Theoretical System for Meaning Gamification, (2012); Pateman C., Participation and Democratic Theory, (1970); Simoes J., Et al., A Social Gamification System for A K-6 Learning Platform, pp. 345-353, (2013); Stowell J.R., Nelson J.M., Benefits of electronic audience response systems on student participation, Learning, and Emotion, (2007); Turner J.C., Patrick H., Motivational Influences on Student Participation in Classroom Learning Activities, (2004); Woods R., Keeler J., The of Instructor's Use of Audio E- mail Messages on Student Participation in and Perceptions of Online Learning, A Prliminary Case Study, (2010); Zichermann G., Cunningham C., Gamification by Design, (2011)",,Ao S.I.; Grundfest W.S.; Douglas C.,Newswood Limited,et al.; IAENG Society of Artificial Intelligence; IAENG Society of Bioinformatics; IAENG Society of Computer Science; IAENG Society of Data Mining; IAENG Society of Electrical Engineering,"2016 World Congress on Engineering and Computer Science, WCECS 2016",19 October 2016 through 21 October 2016,San Francisco,125707,20780958,978-988140471-8,,,English,Lect.

However, little is known regarding how it helps different students experience learning and acquire knowledge. In this paper we study and analyze data from a gamified engineering course, to search for distinct behavior patterns. We examined data collected from two gamified years, between which game changes took place. By clustering students according to their performance, we identified three distinct student types, common to both years: Achievers, Disheartened, and Underachievers. Interestingly, in the second year a new type of student emerged: the Late Awakeners. In this paper we carefully describe each student type, and explain how gamification can provide for smarter learning by catering to students with different profiles. Furthermore, we discuss how our findings, both in gamification and cluster analysis can be used to develop adaptive and smart learning environments. © 2015, Barata et al.; licensee Springer.",Adaptive learning;

The reason for this shift in focus is that, unlike traditional pen and paper assessments, those presented in the form of games are not only designed and encoded with enjoyable game playing mechanisms, but is also capable of capturing salient information about the problem solving processes that individuals use when they work through a problem with another individual. The Assessment and Teaching of 21st Century Skills (ATC21S™) project focused its research on assessing the processes with which a problem is solved in a collaborative environment. This paper draws on the ATC21S™ study, outliningits approach to assessmentdesign and providing justifications for choices made to achieve participant engagement and maintain a learning flow through a game mechanic that preserves learning outcomes. The game design included false leads to encourage students to explore the space and learn through trial and error. These were part of an instructional technique that allowsstudents to learn problem solving skills in steps or through patterns when one or more of the steps are incorrect. This paper provides a consolidated view of the design process of the assessments used in ATC21S™and shows that learning can occur through exploratory as well as collaborative participation in problem solving within the game environment.",Collaboration;

One of the main issues is the reported high dropout rate. In this sense, gamification strategies have been proposed as a complement to existing learning approaches providing a powerful and motivational learning experience to students. Examples of gamification strategies for MOOC environments include rewards for learning activities, applying levels and leader-boards to encourage progress and competition, and badges for participation in forums. The aim of this study is to contribute to the analysis of motivational factors to provide improved learning experiences for cloud-based learning services. This paper presents lessons learned from the MOOC course “Authoring tools for e-learning courses”. 1678 participants experienced a mix of gamification strategies: Badges–Leaderboard forums; Students Classifier League and Reward strategy. Findings revealed the reward strategy as the most effective one, and indicated increased motivation to complete the assigned learning activities. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",Gamification; Learning engagement; Learning strategies; MOOCs; Motivation,E-learning; Education; Motivation; Students; E-learning course; Educational institutions; Gamification; Learning engagement; Learning experiences; Learning strategy; MOOCs; Practical experience; Engineering education,,,,,"Institute of Information Systems and Computer Media; TU Graz, Internationale Beziehungen und Mobilitätsprogramme","This work was Co-funded by the Erasmus + Programme of the European Union MOOC-Maker (561533-EPP-1-2015-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP).

This article presents a concept and a prototype of a 3D environment used in the current semester to employ the new medium in programming education at universities. The concept brings gamification aspects as well as interaction mechanisms from social media to the virtual 3D environment. It thereby aims to reduce the large number of student dropouts due to failing the programming modules by motivating more and less capable students alike to an increased participation in the practical exercises. It is concluded that the concept is applicable in a much broader spectrum of exercise and tutorial settings. © 2015 IEEE.,computer programming education; gamification; social media; virtual 3D environment; virtual blended learning,Computer programming; Education; Education computing; Engineering education; Social aspects; Social networking (online); Students; Blended learning; Gamification; Programming education; Social media; Virtual 3d environments; E-learning,,,,,,,"Aslan A., Samenieh A., Staudig T., Bauml K., Memorial consequences of environmental context change in children and adults, Experimental Psychology, 57, (2012); Bergman J., Sams A., Flip Your Classroom, (2011); Gaiser B., Lehre im Web 2.0 - Didaktisches Flickwerk Oder Triumph der Individualität?, (2014); Gensch K., Kliegl C., Studienabbruch in MINT-Fächern - Welche Gegenmaßnahmen Können Hochschulen Ergreifen?, (2014); Hamari J., Koivisto J., Sarsa H., Does gamification work? - A literature review of empirical studies on gamification, Proceedings of the 47th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, (2014); Heeter C., Being there: The subjective experience of presence, Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments, (1992); Heublein U., Hutzsch C., Schreiber J., Sommer D., Besuch G., Ursachen des Studienabbruchs in Bachelor-und in herkömmlichen Studiengängen.

While MOOCs have orginated in Canada and the United States, the cMOOC and the xMOOC model used there does not fit entirely with the European take on education. This chapter describes an alternative, collaborative approach of MOOC design. This approach is based on a model already tested in practice and has been further elaborated and evaluated in the Elearning, Communication and Open-data (ECO) project. The pedagogical framework is based on the notion that MOOCs should be designed to accommodate the specific context of open online education with its heterogeneity of learner needs. It differs very much from a traditional classroom approach and needs to put the learner center-stage in a social networked learning environment. The characteristics of such a pedagogical framework are described and it is explained how digital inclusion, ubiquitous learning, and gamification can provide affordances for active participation of learners that meet the learners’ needs. Examples are given of implementation of these aspects in ECO MOOCs and initial reports of user evaluations indicate that learners liked this approach. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2017.",Collaborative learning; Connectivist learning; European MOOC design; Open online education; Pedagogical design; sMOOC; Social learning,,,,,,"Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme, (621127); European Commission, EC","Part of the work carried out has been funded with support from the European Commission, under the ICT Policy Support Programme, as part of the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) in the ECO project under grant agreement no 621127.

Recently, this motivational power has started to be applied to non- game contexts, a practice known as Gamification. This adds gaming elements to non-game processes, motivating users to adopt new behaviors, such as improving their physical condition, working more, or learning something new. This paper describes an experiment in which game-like elements were used to improve the delivery of a Master's level College course, including scoring, levels, leaderboards, challenges and badges. To assess how gamification impacted the learning experience, we compare the gamified course to its non-gamified version from the previous year, using different performance measures. We also assessed student satisfaction as compared to other regular courses in the same academic context. Results were very encouraging, showing significant increases ranging from lecture attendance to online participation, proactive behaviors and perusing the course reference materials. Moreover, students considered the gamified instance to be more motivating, interesting and easier to learn as compared to other courses. We finalize by discussing the implications of these results on the design of future gamified learning experiences. © 2013 IEEE.",Classroom learning; Education; Evaluation; Gamification; Student participation,Education; Motivation; Students; Virtual reality; Classroom learning; Evaluation; Gamification; Learning experiences; Lecture attendances; Online participation; Student participation; Student satisfaction; Teaching,,,,,,,"Squire K.D., Video games in education, International Journal of Intelligent Games & Simulation, 2, 1, pp. 49-62, (2003); De Aguilera M., Mendiz A., Video games and education: (Education in the face of a parallel school""), Computers in Entertainment, 1, 1, pp. 11-110, (2003); Prensky M., Digital natives, digital immigrants part 1, On the Horizon, 9, 5, pp. 1-6, (2001); O'neil H.F., Wainess R., Baker E.L., Classification of learning outcomes: Evidence from the computer games literature, Curriculum Journal, 16, 4, pp. 455-474, (2005); Bennett S., Maton K., Kervin L., The 'digital natives' debate: A critical review of the evidence, British Journal of Educational Technology, 39, 5, pp. 775-786, (2008); McClean P., Saini-Eidukat B., Schwert D., Slator B., White A., Virtual worlds in large enrollment science classes significantly improve authentic learning, Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on College Teaching and Learning, pp. 111-118, (2001); Squire K., Barnett M., Grant J.M., Higginbotham T., Electromagnetism supercharged!: Learning physics with digital simulation games, Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Learning Sciences, Ser.

Their motivational qualities make players more persistent and resilient. In particular, virtual environments have proven to be good learning engagers, as they generate opportunities to create, explore and communicate. Here we present an exploratory study on how student autonomy and creativity can be improved by mixing virtual environments and gamification. To attain this, we added to a gamified course a 2.5D virtual environment that grows along with student grading, called AvatarWorld. There, students are represented by customized avatars, and they also can create custom content. Preliminary results suggest that even though students did not spend too much time in AvatarWorld, they were motivated to perform creative tasks that required knowledge acquired in the course.

We describe our experience with gamification, which we loosely define as a teaching technique that uses social gaming elements to deliver higher education. Over the past three years, we have applied gamification to undergraduate and graduate courses in a leading technical university in the Netherlands and in Europe. Ours is one of the first long-running attempts to show that gamification can be used to teach technically challenging courses. The two gamification-based courses, the first-year B.Sc. course Computer Organization and an M.Sc.-level course on the emerging technology of Cloud Computing, have been cumulatively followed by over 450 students and passed by over 75% of them, at the first attempt. We find that gamification is correlated with an increase in the percentage of passing students, and in the participation in voluntary activities and challenging assignments.

This study examined participant's willingness to take part in gamified activities where reward systems were not directly tied to course grades. Participants enrolled in a technology integration course for preservice teachers, were grouped on subject-specific interests, and designed 30-minute presentations on technology integration. Over two semesters, an optional gaming activity was included in five course sections acting as the treatment group, and four sections acted as non-blind control groups. Data was collected from pre-, mid-, and post-surveys that investigated previous gaming experience, game motivations, group project perceptions, and perceived willingness to participate in the game. The treatment group indicated their perceptions of game play during mid- and post-surveys. Participants in all sections completed meeting history worksheets to describe weekly group and individual meetings. The results indicated significant differences between mid- and post-surveys regarding individual participation, group pursuits, individual work, frequency of group meetings, group preparation, and purchased items. The findings indicated a significant difference between treatment and control groups regarding hours spent in groups. Recommendations were provided for the practice of gamification in educational settings. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Game design; gamification; instructional design; student engagement; teacher education,,,,,,,,"Baek Y.K., What Hinders Teachers in Using Computer and Video Games in the Classroom?

Usability testing yielded positive results, but usability did not translate to usage in a learning environment. In classroom testing, peer-to-peer interactions among student users did not live up to expectations. Gamification, or the use of design elements characteristic for games in non-game contexts, was identified as a possible means to encourage more interaction among users. A study was conducted to examine the influence of gamification on the number of interactions and self-organization that occurs in InterLACE users during a high school Physics learning activity. University students in the Boston area (N = 48) between the ages of 18 and 31 were recruited and randomly assigned in groups of 4-6 to two conditions: gamified and control. Gamifying elements were introduced in the experimental condition, such as rules for earning points, a leaderboard, badges and time constraints. The leaderboard provided immediate feedback on individual scores and rank in relation to other players. Results indicate an increase in interparticipant collaboration indicated by a greater number of interactions (15.37 vs. 4.81 average per person). Participation also increased, as indicated by the count of words posted (303.14 vs 205.99 average per person). The number of self-organized groups formed were also higher (4 vs 1.6), but the difference between the two conditions was not statistically significant.",Collaboration; CSCL; Gamification; Human factors,Computer aided instruction; Distributed computer systems; Education; Human engineering; Online systems; Collaboration; Collaboration environments; Computer Supported Collaborative Learning; CSCL; Experimental conditions; Gamification; Learning environments; Peer-to-peer interaction; Students,,,,,"CEEO; Tufts Center for Engineering and Outreach; National Science Foundation, NSF, (1119321)","We would like to thank the Tufts Center for Engineering and Outreach (CEEO) for sponsoring this study.

It has been defined as the use of gaming elements and mechanics in nongaming environments. While having multiple uses in commercial, military and medical sectors, gamification is using techniques similar to those in games to motivate and engage actions and behaviors. This paper takes a deeper look at techniques suitable for education and e-learning, and comes out with a model that describes the design of educational gamification. The application of gamification in e-learning has been done by following the framework proposed in this paper. This framework combines gamification processes and ordinary e-learning processes in one model called “Gamified e-learning design model” (GED). The ultimate goal of this paper is to expound and demonstrate through empirical means that applying the (GED) model when building elearning platform can improve the students’ participation, performance, and motivation, and thus it promotes learning. The result of the experiment is the demonstration that gamification can promote, engage and enhance learning. It has been proved by gathering data using questionnaires and by examining selected group of students that have experienced the gamified system used in testing. Although most of the results were positive, there is still a need for further research and testing for gamification use in learning applications. There is also a need for testing in bigger environment, involving larger amount of participants. © 2016 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.",e-Learning; Gamification; Gamified e-Learning Design Model (GED); Gamified e-Learning platforms,,,,,,,,"Dominguez A., Saenz-De-Navarrete J., De-Marcos L., Fernandez-Sanz L., Pages C., Martinez-Herraiz J.J., Gamifying learning experiences: Practical implications and outcomes, Computers & Education, 63, pp. 380-392; Gee P.J., Learning by Design: Good Video Games as Learning Machines; Ebner M., Holzinger A., Successful implementation of user-centered game based learning in higher education: An example of civil engineering, Computers and Education, 49, 2007, pp. 873-890, (2007); Prensky M., Digital natives, digital immigrants, Part II: Do they really think differently?, On the Horizon, 9, 6, (2001); Bourgonjon J., Valcke M., Soetaert R., Schellens T., Students’ perceptions about the use of video games in the classroom, Computer and Education, an International Journal, 54, pp. 1145-1156, (2010); McGonigal J., Reality is Broken, Why Games Make Us Better and How they Can Change the World, (2011); Adriana R., Gamification: An Option Or a Necessity?, (2012); Zichermann G., Fun is the Future: Mastering Gamification, (2010); Kapp Karl M., The Gamification of Learning and Instruction, (2012); John A., Why Use Gamification: The Power of Games, (2013); Chloe C., Gamification and Motivation: Tapping into Psychology, (2012); Per H., Taking Gamification to the Next Level; Fogg B.J., A Behavior Model for Persuasive Design, (2009); Robin H., Marc L., Robert Z., MDA: A Formal Approach to Game Design and Game Research, (2004); Kevin W., Gamification, (2014); Johnson L., Adams S., Cummins M., The NMC Horizon Report: 2013 Higher Education Edition, (2013); Van Eck R., Digital Game-Based Learning: It’s Not Just the Digital Natives Who are Restless, (2006); Robson R., WWW-Based Course –support Systems: The first Generation, International Journal of Educational Telecommunications, 5, 4, pp. 271-282, (2008); Piotrowski M., What is an e-learning platform?, Learning Management System Technologies and Software Solutions for Online Teaching: Tools and Applications, (2010); Kevin W., (Re)Defining Gamification: A Process Approach, (2014); Gamification Process; Badrul K.H., A Comprehensive E-Learning Model, (2005); Lily S., Shirley W., Kecheng L., Knowledge Construction in E-Learning: Designing an E-Learning Environment, (2004); Herzig P., Ameling M., Implementing Gamification: Requirements and Gamification Platforms, Gamification in Education and Business, pp. 431-450; Labs O., Gamification Guidelines, (2015)",,,Praise Worthy Prize,,,,,,18286003,,,,English,Int.

Although gamification has a great potential in higher education, existing research focuses on competitive approaches and presents contrasting evidence. We present a social gamification approach and tool designed to address the situated motivational affordances of students (relatedness, competence and autonomy). An experiment (N = 374) is conducted to test it in an undergraduate course, comparing students' performance with a traditional blended-learning approach. Students' attitude towards the new tool is also analyzed. Results suggest that social gamification can be used to improve the overall academic performance in practical assignments and to promote social interaction. However, our findings also raise and important caveat. The creation of gamified experiences for higher education requires a deep knowledge of the motivational affordances of students and a careful design of the rewards that are introjected by students and that eventually stimulate participation. © 2017 Tempus Publications.",E-learning;

Students had online access to the publicly available applications used for communicating and coordinating activities with each other. Gamification principles guided some of the course procedures, such as a point system, feedback, awards and penalties, social networking, team tasks, individual options. A theoretical framework is proposed for understanding how to manage instructional intersubjectivity for students meeting online. Student thinking and motivation is observed to be higher under conditions of intersubjectivity in comparison to doing the same tasks alone. Learning from each other through participation promotes intersubjectivity when the instructional strategy installs technological affordances that keep each student informed of what the others are doing in context, and how they are reacting or responding to each other. © 2013, IGI Global.",Biological; Communicative Action; Gamification; Immersive; Intersubjectivity; Online Teaching; Optimizing; Satisficing; Second Life; Virtual,Engineering education; Ontology; Biological; Communicative actions; Gamification; Immersive; Intersubjectivity; Online teaching; Optimizing; Satisficing; Second Life; Virtual; Students,,,,,,,"Bell L., Trueman R.B., Virtual Worlds, Real Libraries: Librarians and Educators in Second Life and Other Multi-user Environments, (2008); Blascovich J., Bailenson J., Infinite Reality: Avatars, Eternal Life, New Worlds, and the Dawn of the Virtual Revolution, (2011); Boss S., How Project-based Learning Builds 21st-century Skills [Web Log Post], (2012); Boss S., Krauss J., Reinventing Project-based Learning: Your Field Guide to Real-world Projects in the Digital Age, (2007); Collins A., Halverson R., Rethinking Education in the Age of Technology: The Digital Revolution and Schooling in America, (2009); Dahlstrom E., De Boor T., Grunwald P., Vockley M., ECAR National Study of Undergraduate Students and Information Technology 2011, (2011); De Freitas S., Serious Virtual Worlds: A Scoping Study, (2008); Floridi L., A look into the future impact of ICT on our lives, The Information Society: An International Journal, 23, 1, pp. 59-64, (2007); Gee J.P., What Video Games Have to Teach Us about Learning and Literacy (2nd Ed.), (2007); Habermas J., The Theory of Communicative Action, 1, (1984); Head A.J., Eisenberg M.B., Truth Be Told: How College Students Evaluate and Use Information in the Digital Age, (2010); James L., Creating an online course generational curriculum, Connected Minds, Emerging Cultures: Cybercultures in Online Learning, pp. 91-118, (2009); Kapp K.M., The Gamification of Learning and Instruction: Game-based Methods and Strategies for Training and Education, (2012); Kapp K.M., O'Driscoll T., Learning in 3D: Adding A New Dimension to Enterprise Learning and Collaboration, (2010); Kzero W., VW Age Profiles 2011 [PowerPoint Slides], (2011); McGonigal J., Reality Is Broken: Why Games Make Us Better and How They Can Change the World, (2011); McNally T., Can Computer Games Save Us All?

A student's learning success can benefit from gamified project work, especially when students face self-guided learning processes in demanding educational activities. Gamification is defined as the use of game elements in a non-game context. Games offer the chance to improve the motivation of students, support group work, train communication skills and introduce the capacity for experimenting in safe environments. Therefore the learning effect of prospective engineers can be increased through the integration of Gamification into educational activities. This leads to higher student participation in university courses and encourages the development of the student's social, personal and technical competences. In this paper a game concept for teaching in universities is introduced focusing on the impartment of the state of the art on manufacturing for value creation, e.g. production planning and control. The concept covers a level based storyline with rules and goals using physical artefacts of Lego Mindstorms. Due to the modular characteristic of Lego, which supports creativity by having a high number of possible combinations, a ""free playing space"" for students is established. In groups, the students work in a highly problem oriented way, e.g. finding cost savings for their factory due to a changing market condition. Feedback in the sense of the success of student's strategies is given directly through the designed Lego model and its functionality. © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We empirically investigate this by exploring the impact of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation on the participation and performance of over 100 undergraduate students in an online gamified learning intervention. The paper makes a number of contributions. First, by synthesizing the literature the central concepts required for a learning intervention to be considered gamified are mapped and the development of an online gamified learning intervention is described. Second, the effect of gamification on learning outcomes is examined using a pre- and post-intervention survey. We find that gamified learning interventions have a positive impact on student learning. Third, our results show that while generally positive, the impact of gamified intervention*ns on student participation varies depending on whether the student is motivated intrinsically or extrinsically. These findings will be of practical interest to teaching and learning practitioners working in a range of educational contexts, and at all levels of education, who wish to increase student engagement and enhance learning. © 2014 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",extrinsic motivation; gamification; intrinsic motivation; prediction market,,,,,,,,"Bergmann J., Sams A., Flip your classroom: Reach every student in every class every day, (2012); Brophy J.E., Motivating students to learn, (2013); Buckley P., Garvey J., McGrath F., A case study on using prediction markets as a rich environment for active learning, Computers & Education, 56, 2, pp. 418-428, (2011); Cokley K.O., Bernard N., Cunningham D., Motoike J., A psychometric investigation of the academic motivation scale using a United States sample, Measurement and Evaluation in Counseling and Development, 34, 2, pp. 109-119, (2001); Deci E.L., Koestner R., Ryan R.M., Extrinsic rewards and intrinsic motivation in education: Reconsidered once again, Review of Educational Research, 71, 1, pp. 1-27, (2001); Deterding S., Dixon D., Khaled R., Nacke L., (2011); Dominguez A., Saenz-de-Navarrete J., de-Marcos L., Fernandez-Sanz L., Pages C., Martinez-Herraiz J.-J., Gamifying learning experiences: Practical implications and outcomes, Computers & Education, 63, pp. 380-392, (2013); Elam C., Stratton T., Gibson D.D., Welcoming a new generation to college: The millennial students, Journal of College Admission, (2007); Ellis C.M., Sami R., Learning political science with prediction markets: An experimental study, PS: Political Science & Politics, 45, 2, pp. 277-284, (2012); Evans A.J., Pedagogical synergies between Austrian economics and the case method, The Journal of Private Enterprise, 28, 1, pp. 91-103, (2012); Fairchild A.J., Horst S.J., Finney S.J., Barron K.E., Evaluating existing and new validity evidence for the academic motivation scale, Contemporary Educational Psychology, 30, 3, pp. 331-358, (2005); (2011); Garvey J., Buckley P., Teaching the concept of risk: Blended learning using a custom-built prediction market, Journal of Teaching in International Business, 21, 4, pp. 346-357, (2010); Glover I., Herrington J., Couros A., Irvine V., Play as you learn: Gamification as a technique for motivating learners, Proceedings of World Conference on Educational Multimedia, Hypermedia and Telecommunications, 2013, pp. 1999-2008, (2013); Harlen W., Deakin Crick R., Testing and motivation for learning, Assessment in Education: Principles, Policy & Practice, 10, 2, pp. 169-207, (2003); Howe N., Strauss W., Millennials go to college: Strategies for a new generation on campus, (2003); Kapp K.M., The gamification of learning and instruction: Game-based methods and strategies for training and education, (2012); Kim B., Harnessing the power of game dynamics why, how to, and how not to gamify the library experience, College & Research Libraries News, 73, 8, pp. 465-469, (2012); Kozma R.B., (2003); Lee J., Hammer J., Gamification in education: What, how, why bother?, 15, 2, (2011); (2013); Maehr M.L., Meyer H.A., Understanding motivation and schooling: Where we've been, where we are, and where we need to go, Educational Psychology Review, 9, 4, pp. 371-409, (1997); McGonigal J., (2011); Nicholson S., (2012); Piaget J., Cook M., The origins of intelligence in children, (1952); Raban D., Geifman D., Designing online information aggregation and prediction markets for MBA courses, Interdisciplinary Journal of E-Learning and Learning Objects, 5, pp. 247-262, (2010); Race P., Making learning happen: a guide for post-compulsory education, (2010); Ryan R.M., Deci E.L., Intrinsic and extrinsic motivations: Classic definitions and new directions, Contemporary Educational Psychology, 25, 1, pp. 54-67, (2000); Salen K., Zimmerman E., Rules of play: Game design fundamentals, (2004); Sambell K., McDowell L., Montgomery C., Assessment for learning in higher education, (2012); Simoes J., Redondo R.D., Vilas A.F., A social gamification framework for a K-6 learning platform, Computers in Human Behavior, 29, 2, pp. 345-353, (2013); Skinner B.F., About behaviorism, (1976); Smith-Robbins S., This game sucks”: How to improve the gamification of education, Educause Review, 46, 1, pp. 58-59, (2011); Squire K., Video games in education, International Journal Intelligent Games & Simulation, 2, 1, pp. 49-62, (2003); Tziralis G., Tatsiopoulos I., Prediction markets: An extended literature review, The Journal of Prediction Markets, 1, 1, pp. 75-91, (2007); Vallerand R.J., Pelletier L.G., Blais M.R., Briere N.M., Senecal C., Vallieres E.F., The academic motivation scale: A measure of intrinsic, extrinsic, and amotivation in education, Educational and Psychological Measurement, 52, 4, pp. 1003-1017, (1992); Zichermann G., Cunningham C., Gamification by design: Implementing game mechanics in web and mobile apps, (2011)","E.

Here, we give a perspective on how new technologies might be used through student-centred teaching approaches. First, a snapshot of recent trends in the higher education is provided; then, a brief account is given of how digital technologies [e.g., massive open online courses (MOOCs), flipped classroom (FC), games, quizzes, dedicated Facebook, and digital badges] might promote parasitology teaching and learning in digital learning environments. In our opinion, some of these digital technologies might be useful for competency-based, self-regulated, learner-centred teaching and learning in an online or blended teaching environment. Participation rates in the higher education sector are higher than ever.The demands for improved access by students to learning materials, the development of life-long learning toolkits, and flexible study options for students are increasing.Digital technologies offer unprecedented opportunities to respond to some of the challenges posed by these trends in the higher education sector.Digital technologies, including MOOCs, FCs, gamification, social networking sites, digital badges, and learning analytics, are some of the recent innovations that could revolutionise the teaching and learning of parasitology in the digital world. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Digital technologies; Learning; Parasitology; Teaching,Computers; Educational Technology; Online Systems; Parasitology; Teaching; human; human experiment; learning; learning environment; parasitology; social network; teaching; computer; education; educational technology; online system; parasitology; standards; teaching; trends,,,,,,,"Eckert J., WAAVP/Pfizer award for excellence in teaching veterinary parasitology: teaching of veterinary parasitology--quo vadis?, Vet.

After a brief prior familiarization with the main features of learning and educational paradigms in the twenty-first century as well as with effective teaching strategies and pedagogical methodologies in such a context, it will move towards the clarification of the meaning of the aforementioned terms and other related concepts in what might be called the framework of playful learning. Straightaway, a detailed description of the main applicable strategies to develop an effective gamified proposal will be offered. These playful techniques have a significant ability to influence learners' motivation and strengthen their commitment to training projects while their participation, engagement, curiosity, fantasy and desire for adventures are stimulated and developed. They also have plenty of remarkable chances in the field of behavioral modeling, a topic also discussed in the chapter and whose applications within Education, and in any other economic or social area, are numerous and varied. The final level of this challenge is an exploration of the key game-based design elements (aesthetics, dynamics, mechanics and components) to close the overview of the landscape that is presented. © 2015, IGI Global.

However, in the real world, the strategy in primary schools seems to be to lock out media usage altogether in order to avoid trouble. The educational techniques behind media literacy, especially in respect to feature films, are very often reduced to providing an interpretational understanding of the story or knowledge about the production process. We argue that even for younger pupils, the reflection of design components and aesthetical structures is also relevant. In a more and more media driven society, processes of identity formation are increasingly attached to individual's media consumption and his or her social embedding. As Mikos (2000) points out, this process creates the phenomenon that the social relationships of younger generations depend to a high degree on aesthetic criteria. Therefore, aesthetic competence is an important requirement for one's ability to reflect on individual lifestyles. Gamification and Interactive Storytelling as a Pedagogical Concept: s aesthetic reflection is a highly subjective matter, the pedagogical methodology has to focus on creating individual experiences. In order to foster the perception of formal structures and raise awareness of different design qualities, we consider a pragmatic approach for the general structure, which encourages experimental exploration and creative activities (Joas 1988, Kerres/Witt 2002). Additionally, we pursue a gamification concept in the sense of meaningful gamification, as described by Nicholson. He focuses on an understanding of gamification which enables playful participation and is based on the freedom of exploration. This creates the possibility of making meaningful decisions enabled by an informational context, which engages people through social interactions. It is assumed that a playful activity involving film design components as variable structures can enhance an aesthetic and therefore more abstract perception of the presented film plots (see Sutton-Smith 1972, Ohler 1994, Friess 2011). Conceptual Approach for an Interactive Media Environment: The core concept behind the educational application is built upon an interactive storytelling tool, which allows the creation of different variations of the same story. In order to set up a situational context that confronts the pupils with a design problem, we introduce a narrative framework with two children arguing about the way they can design a short film. The narrative context is used to give the pupils the necessary information on design possibilities, allowing them to make decisions in the later experimental part. The application should be embedded in a blended learning situation. This means that a teacher introduces the informational portion, and more importantly, that the pupils can show and discuss their final versions of the short film within the class community. The project is realised at Furtwangen University and supported by the Institute for Media and Communication of Baden-Württemberg. The prototype will be evaluated with primary-school pupils in summer 2015.",Aesthetic education; Film design; Gamification; Interactive storytelling; Pragmatic didactics,Design; Motion pictures; Teaching; Conceptual approaches; Educational Applications; Film design; Gamification; Individual lifestyles; Interactive storytelling; Pragmatic didactics; Social relationships; Education,,,,,,,"Branigan E., Narrative Comprehension and Film; Friess R., Narrative versus spielerische Rezeption?

What kind of sociability is promoted in the gamification of education? This article explores how student behaviour and interaction change when introducing game elements into a university course, for example by awarding points for different types of active participation during class. Based on student responses and actions during the course, as well as on the teacher experiences and observations, the article underlines the importance of understanding how the teacher can affect students' motivation, social contact and their experience of the learning situation through a balanced use of learning, play elements and game elements. This paper, which examines a course worth five ECTS points on gamification and comprised 20 students from Aalborg University Copenhagen in autumn 2013, evaluates the course and presents a qualitative data analysis (Flick 2014) of observations and interviews concerning the course. The article's empirical data consists of observations of teaching and audio recordings from the first and last lecture, a 45-minute individual interview with 14 students, 15 questionnaire responses and 16 written student evaluations of the course. Furthermore, the empirical data include 19 responses from the students on their motivation for participating in the course. This paper presents an analysis of how students felt about the interaction they experienced during the gamified course and is based on a specific framework (Bateson 2000) and the type of sociability (Simmel 1979) that occurred in relationship to the play that took place. As a result, this paper contributes to the literature by presenting and discussing its findings on the interaction we design for when using game elements in a learning context. Experimentation and the interactions that take place between peers and with teachers are how students learn about the topic at hand. Inviting students to participate in a gamified course on gamification is a meta-pedagogical approach that allowed students to experience gamification and learn from it. This means that the educational design was also supposed to provoke the students at times. We found that playful competiveness among students promotes more activity, but does so at a cost as students found the approach stressful and limiting.

One such domain which is exciting increased academic and practitioner interest is education. While demonstrating the potential utility of gamification as a pedagogical tool, this research has also highlighted several areas that require further investigation before definitive conclusions can be drawn. In particular, there are repeated calls in the literature for empirical investigations into the impact of gamification at the level of the individual. This paper investigates how differing learning styles amongst individuals impacts upon the utility of gamification as a pedagogical tool. We measure three independent variables: individual's perception of gamification, individuals participation in a gamified learning intervention and individuals performance in a gamified learning intervention. The data suggests three significant relationships. The data shows that individuals who have an active learning style have a positive perception of gamification. Individuals whose learning style is global also have a positive perception of gamification. In terms of performance, we find that individuals who have a tendency towards a global learning style also perform better in the gamified learning intervention. © The Authors, 2016.

Nevertheless, many employers complain that graduates do not have the required skills. Lately, the higher education sector has faced a continuous decrease in the number of students choosing to study computer science courses, and some of the reasons for this rejection are related to the difficulties in mastering computer science skills. As core subjects in a computer science major, programming language subjects play an important role in successful tertiary computer science education. The embedding of gamification in programming courses has been identified as a potential technique that could maximize student participation and have a positive impact on learning. This research aims to provide an overview of how the embedding of gamification in online collaborative learning can enhance participation among novice programming students. The main findings from this review include the identification of the important participation elements for programming students in the online collaborative learning environment, a list of game elements embedded in online collaborative learning to facilitate participation among programming students, and suggestions regarding suitable gamification approaches for programming courses.",Game elements; Gamification; Online collaborative learning; Participation; Programming courses,,,,,,,,"Bacon L., MacKinnon L., Computer science graduates why do they top unemployment tables_Higher Education Network_The Guardian, (2013); Porta M., (2011); Iosup A., Epema D., An experience report on using gamification in technical higher education, pp. 27-32, (2014); Porta M., Maillet K., Gil M., Dec-CS: the computer science declining phenomenon, 2, (2011); Qu W.-Q., Et al., Research on teaching gamification of software engineering,  International Conference on Computer Science & Education.

Since 2011, gamification has continuously been recorded as a medium-term trend of online education in the annually published Horizon Report. In all areas in which engagement, participation, and motivation of individuals are the key success factors, strategies of gamification are considered. But, what are potentials of gamification in the field of higher education? How can educational technologies such as learning management systems be gamified? An essential part of this article is a study regarding the gamification of the learning management system OPAL. Design/methodology/approach - Based on a master thesis at the faculty of educational sciences, a study was conducted in order to investigate how the use of game elements can increase the attractiveness of OPAL for students. OPAL is the central learning management system at the Technische Universität Dresden. The study should answer the question: Which game design elements increase the attractiveness of OPAL for students? The research question was answered with a qualitative approach, while the collection of data was carried out by a focus group and expert interviews. The sample included six master's students and one expert. The findings provide recommendations for redesigning OPAL. Originality/value - Often gamification is related to tools like points, badges, and leaderboards. But what elements exist beyond these? The contribution initially provides conceptual foundations and refers to game mechanics as the specifics of games. Based on this, the potential of gamification in higher education teaching was discussed.

Thirty-five patients attending a Canadian thalassemia clinic were enrolled. Acting in an expert role, they participated in a Delphi method to reach consensus as to what tools and information should be incorporated in the development of a self management Smartphone app. One- and 6-month usability and health impact feedback surveys were built-in. Sixty percent of responders were 18–34 years old, over 50.0% had a college degree. The Delphi method successfully generated a comprehensive list of features important to patients. The app has been downloaded 147 times globally. Between March 2015 and January 2016, 19 responses for the 1-month survey were collected and the trends described. Responders reported improved medication adherence. The personal adherence pledge feature supports gamification of health apps to individualize goals of therapy. The impact of tracking iron levels was highly favorable. The Delphi method was an effective way to introduce a patient education and empowerment tool to the thalassemia population. The long-term impact requires data maturation. Use of validated methodology is essential to ensure ehealth interventions are positively contributing to patient education and disease outcomes. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Adherence; chelation; self-management; smartphone; thalassemia,Adolescent; Adult; Disease Management; Humans; Iron Overload; Medication Adherence; Mobile Applications; Patient Education as Topic; Patient Participation; Smartphone; Thalassemia; ferritin; iron; iron chelating agent; adult; Article; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; clinical article; college; consensus; Delphi study; educational status; empowerment; feasibility study; ferritin blood level; hepatography; human; iron blood level; iron overload; medication compliance; mobile application; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; patient compliance; patient education; patient participation; quality of life; self care; smartphone; social status; thalassemia; adolescent; disease management; iron overload; mobile application; patient education; patient participation; procedures; smartphone; thalassemia; trends; utilization,,"ferritin, 9007-73-2; iron, 14093-02-8, 53858-86-9, 7439-89-6",,,,,"Weatherall D.J., The definition and epidemiology of non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia, Blood Rev, 26, pp. S3-S6, (2012); (2011); Modell B., Khan M., Darlinson M., Improved survival of thalassemia major in the UK and relation to T2* cardiovascular magnetic resonance, J Cardiovasc Magn Reson, 10, (2008); Olivieri N.F., Brittenham G.M., Iron-chelating therapy and the treatment of thalassemia, Blood, 89, 3, pp. 739-761, (1997); Peters M., Heijboer H., Smiers F., Et al., Diagnosis and management of thalassemia, Br Med J, 344, (2012); Borgna-Pignatti C., Rugolotto S., De Stefano P., Survival and complications in patients with thalassemia major treated with transfusion and deferoxamine, Haematologica, 89, 10, pp. 1187-1193, (2004); Christiansen S., Gupta A., Can mobile technology improve treatment of chronic pain?, Pain Med, 15, 8, pp. 1434-1435, (2014); Irvine A.B., Russell H., Manocchia M., Mobile-web app to self-manage low back pain: randomized controlled trial, J Med Internet Res, 17, (2015); Danes M., Whinder F., Diabetes management goes digital, Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol, 1, 1, pp. 17-18, (2013); Fisher J.D., Amico K.R., Fisher W.A., Computer-based intervention in HIV clinical care setting improves antiretroviral adherence: the Life Windows Project, AIDS Behav, 15, 8, pp. 1635-1646, (2011); O'Hara D.M., Seagriff-Curtin P., Levitz M., Using Personal Digital Assistants to improve self-care in oral health, J Telemed Telecare, 14, 3, pp. 150-151, (2008); Borsci S., Federici S., Lauriola M., On the dimensionality of the System Usability Scase: a test of alternative measurement models, Cogn Process, 10, 3, pp. 193-197, (2009); Trachtenberg F.L., Gestenberger E., Xu Y., Relationship among chelator adherence, change in chelators, and quality of life in thalassemia, Qual Life Res, 23, 8, pp. 2277-2288, (2014); Al-Kloub M.I., Nayel Salameh T., Froelicher E.S., Impact of psychosocial status and disease knowledge on deferoxamine adherence among thalassemia major adolescents, Int J Nurs Pract, 20, 3, pp. 265-274, (2014); Al-Kloub M.I., A Bed M.A., Al Khawaldeh O.A., Predictors of non-adherence to follow-up visits and deferasirox chelation therapy among Jordanian adolescents with Thalassemia major, Pediatr Hematol Oncol, 31, 7, pp. 624-637, (2014); Kuo K.H.M., Ward R., Application of self-efficacy theory in adherence to iron chelation therapy: a single-center cross-sectional study, Blood, 118, 21, (2011); Reeves G., Jauch L.R., Curriculum development through Delphi, Res High Educ, 8, 2, pp. 157-168, (1978)","R.

However, it is very common to students to become bored or disengaged using ITS. The inclusion of gamification capabilities (e.g., level, points and so on) in ITS design aims to engage students and to drive desired learning behaviors. Researchers have been noting that teachers are increasingly demanding to act as active users of systems with such features. In this context, the main challenge of this project is contributing to the actively participation (i.e., design) of teachers in the use of gamified intelligent tutoring systems. This challenge leads to the following research questions: (i) ""how could we enable teachers to customize the construction of gamified ITS in a simple way and without requiring technical capabilities from them?""; and (ii) ""how could we also provide good design principles in order to aid teachers in the customization of gamified ITS?"". Thus, our aim is to develop an intelligent authoring platform to enable teachers for customizing gamified ITSs. In this way, we describe in this text a set of specific objectives that must be completed to achieve this general aim.",Gamification; Intelligent Authoring; Intelligent Tutoring Systems,Behavioral research; Computer aided instruction; Education; Highway planning; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Gamification; Good designs; Instructional model; Intelligent Authoring; Intelligent tutoring system; Learning behavior; Research questions; Technical capabilities; Teaching,,,,,,,"Aleven V., Sewall J., Popescu O., Van Velsen M., Demi S., Leber B., Reecting on twelve years of its authoring tools research with ctat, Design Recommendations for Intelligent Tutoring Systems: Authoring Tools and Expert Modeling Techniques, (2015); Ataide W.A., Brito P.H., Silva A.P., Costa E., Bittencourt I.I., Tenfforio T., A semantic tool to assist authors in the instantiation of software product lines for intelligent tutoring systems context, IEEE Technology and Engineering Education (ITEE), 7, 3, pp. 52-61, (2012); Benavides D., Felfernig A., Galindo J., Reinfrank F., Automated analysis in feature modelling and product configuration, J.

Throughout time they have been adapted to different contexts and needs. Nowadays, badges are used in different contexts, spaces (real and online) and with different purposes, but with the same aim: recognize something with value inside a community. In educational contexts, badges have been used to recognize skills mastering, achievements and in progress orientation. More recently, badges became digital and are used also to certify MOOC participation and to acknowledge soft skills, i.e. in not formal and informal learning experiences. Digital Badges have important characteristics that interest to education and employability. A badge is more than an image, as it represents a skill or experience that his/her owner has. It is also possible to see the evidence made by the owner to receive that badge and several data about or associated with the issuer. These features give credibility to digital badges' issuing, and made them interesting to both education and recruitment fields. It is under these features and all its potential that projects like ""Cities of Learning"" in USA and ""Open Badge Network"" in EU emerged recently. A very important question is how badges can enhance education. For some authors and practitioners, badges can be used in continuing processes with employability aims. For others, its main benefit is related with motivational purposes inside the classroom. Today, as we search the Web, we can find different online tools for both aims. In this paper, we will describe the evolution of badges, the uses made in education and recent international projects that focus on the use of badges. Finally, we will put forward ways that can help teachers to use badges in their classrooms.",Badges; Connected communities; Digital Badges; Feedback and assessment; Gamification,Education; Social networking (online); Teaching; Badges; Digital Badges; Educational context; Gamification; Informal learning; International projects; On-line tools; Soft skills; E-learning,,,,,,,"Abramovich S., Schunn C., Higashi R.M., Are badges useful in education?: It depends upon the type of badge and expertise of learner, Educational Technology Research and Development, 61, 2, pp. 217-232, (2013); Antin J., Churchill E.F., Badges in Social Media: A Social Psychological Perspective, pp. 1-4, (2011); Casilli C., Knight E., 7 Things You Should Know about Badges, (2012); Chou Y., Actionable Gamification: Beyong Points, Badges, and Leaderboards, (2015); Foster J.C., The Promise of Digital Badges, pp. 31-34, (2013); Gee J.P., What Video Games Have to Teach Us about Learning and Literacy, (2003); Gibson D., Et al., Digital badges in education, Education and Information Technologies, 20, 2, pp. 403-410, (2015); Grant S.L., History and context of open digital badges, Digital Badges in Education: Trends, Issues, and Cases, pp. 3-11, (2016); Halavais A.M.C., A Genealogy of Badges: Inherited meaning and monstrous moral hybrids, Information, Communication & Society, 15, 3, pp. 354-373, (2012); Hamari J., Do badges increase user activity ?

Recent studies have shown that badges can be effective to incentivize learners to complete specific tasks in online learning environments. This study examined the impact of a badge system on class participation and interaction for both online and face-To-face classes in a graduate program. Badges were issued for students who contributed to quality class discussion and peer project comments in two different types of courses. Results of student online postings in different types of online classes with and without a badge system implemented were analyzed. The findings indicate that badges can enhance student interaction in traditional online courses where activities mainly consist of reading, writing, reflecting and commenting.",Badges; Gamification; Interaction; Online learning; Online participation,Computer aided instruction; Computer games; Education; Students; Badges; Gamification; Interaction; Online learning; Online participation; E-learning,,,,,,,"Open Badges for Higher Education, (2013); Allred C.R., Swenson M.J., Using technology to increase student preparation for and participation in marketing courses: The random selector model, Marketing Education Review, 16, pp. 15-21, (2006); Anderson A., Huttenlocher D., Kleinberg J., Leskovec J., Steering user behavior with badges, Proceedings of World Wide Web 2013 Conference, (2013); Dede C., The evolution of distance education: Emerging technologies and distributed learning, American Journal of Distance Education, 10, 2, pp. 4-36, (1996); Denny P., The effect of virtual achievements on student engagement, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, pp. 763-772, (2013); Deterding S., Gamification: Designing for motivation, Interactions, 19, 4, pp. 14-17, (2012); 7 Things you Should Know about Badges, (2012); Kuh G.D., Assessing what really matters to student learning: Inside the National Survey of Student Engagement, Change, 33, 3, pp. 10-17, (2001); Haaranen L., Ihantola P., Hakulinen L., Korhonen A., How (not) to introduce badges to online exercises, Proceedings of the 45th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education, pp. 33-38, (2014); Handelsman M.M., Briggs W.L., Sullivan N., Towler A., A measure of college student course engagement, The Journal of Educational Research, 98, 3, pp. 184-191, (2005); Howe N., Strauss W., Millennials Rising: The Next Great Generation, (2000); Digital Badges, (2015); OpenBadges, (2012); Sullivan F.M., New and Alternative Assessments, Digital Badges, and Civics: An Overview of Emerging Themes and Promising Directions, (2013); Wegerif R., The social dimension of asynchronous learning networks, Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks, 2, 1, pp. 34-49, (1998); Wellman B., The network community: An introduction to networks in the global village, Networks in the Global Village, pp. 1-48, (1999)",,Wu Y-T.; Kojiri T.; Kong S.C.; Qiu F.; Ogata H.; Supnithi T.; Wang Y.; Chen W.,Asia-Pacific Society for Computers in Education,,"23rd International Conference on Computers in Education, ICCE 2015",30 November 2015 through 4 December 2015,Hangzhou,131817,,978-499080147-2,,,English,"Workshop Proc.

It looks, in detail, at various project development stages and methodologies used to engage design focused students into, often complex, technological issues. The discussion is contextualized through a number of case studies of mobile and marker-based augmented reality (AR) applications developed by students. These applications include an app for a fashion based social event that allows participants to preview recent collection additions, an info-navigational app for the High Line elevated urban park in New York City, a marker-based maze game, and an interior decorating interface to visualize various furnishing scenarios. While a number of case studies will be discussed from a developer perspective, the primary focus is on the concept and content development, interface design, and user participation. © 2014, Education and research in Computer Aided Architectural Design in Europe.

Recent studies analyze the relationship between entrepreneurial attitude and different learning experiences. However, there is a lack of studies that relate entrepreneurship and business simulations with adopted gamification techniques. Moreover, even though some studies have been focused on management students at college and university level, entrepreneurial attitude in high school students has remained practically unnoticed for educational research. In this study, the entrepreneurial attitude of high school students is analyzed on the basis of the EAO (Entrepreneurship Attitude Orientation) scale through the participation of students on a gamified business simulation. Results have been obtained through a specific experience of gamified business simulation for students from different high schools of the province of Granada (Spain) in which near 1000 students from ages 16 to 18 that had taken basic business and economics subjects were involved over a gamified business simulation competition of 20 weeks. Results show that all EAO dimensions are positively affected by the gamified simulation experience except Personal Control. Thus, inclusion of this type of gamified simulation experiences in high school curricula is highly desirable to, among other positive effects; lower the psychological barriers related to self-esteem or lack of innovativeness that could inhibit individuals from becoming entrepreneurs. © 2016, Ministry Education and Science.

Typically game based learning necessitates the integration of learning content or embodies the learning objectives within the game mechanics. However in this study, game mechanics were applied to the construction of a reward based system that acted as an incentive for students to engage in class discussion. Students were provided with a virtual tree which grew and developed in response to points assigned for participation in class discussions. The discussion was evidence of engagement with the required material. The majority of students reported increased participation in the class as a direct result of the virtual tree game, identifying 'friendly competition' and a 'sense of fun' as motivating factors. This approach to motivating learning via a game that is not embedded in the class content provides flexibility and simplicity by allowing the educator to direct student attention to tasks deemed most necessary to the required learning outcome, by assigning points to those activities thereby fueling the game and student learning. This paper focused on the difference in behaviour of students in groups versus individual in such a game. © The Authors, 2014.",Class engagement; Competition; Education; Game based learning; Games; Gamification; Reward systems; Team behaviour,Competition; Education; Neural Networks; Competition; Education; Forestry; Internet; Motivation; Social networking (online); Class engagement; Game-based Learning; Games; Gamification; Reward systems; Team behaviour; Students,,,,,,,"Burguillo J.C., Using game theory and Competition-based Learning to stimulate student motivation and performance, Computers & Education, 55, 2, pp. 566-575, (2010); Behrens A., New Your Times Open Blog, (2013); Cohen A., The Gamification of Education, The Futurist, 45, pp. 16-17, (2011); Cronk R., Using Non-interactive Games to Increase Student Engagement and Participation in Class Discussion, (2012); Danforth L., Games and Literature, Library Journal, 134, 13, (2009); Gladwell M., The tipping point: how little things can make a big difference, (2000); Hulten B., DeVries D., 'Team Competition and Group Practice: Effects on Student Achievement and Attitudes, (1976); Putnam R.D., Bowling alone: the collapse and revival of American community, (2000); Robinson S., Ritzko J., Increasing student engagement through electronic response devices, (2006); Turkle S., Alone together: why we expect more from technology and less from each other, (2011); Wilen W.W., Refuting Misconceptions about Classroom Discussion, The Social Studies, January/February, Proceedings of the Academy for Educational Leadership, 11, 1, pp. 79-82, (2004); Yin R.K., Case study research: design and methods, (1989)",,Busch C.,Dechema e.V.,,,,,,20490992,978-191030955-1,,,English,Proc.
